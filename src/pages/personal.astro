      I am, by most measures, bad at the things that are supposed to matter — networking, self-promotion, operating. I am a thinker in a world that rewards operators. And yet here I am, building anyway.

    <!-- Section: The Long Way Around -->
    <section class="mb-20">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-8">

        <h2 class="text-sm font-medium tracking-widest text-zinc-500 uppercase">The Long Way Around</h2>
        <div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-l from-zinc-700 to-transparent flex-1"></div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I started in computer science because that's what you did if you were good at math and bad at knowing what you wanted. Then political science, because I got curious about why people make the choices they do — not individually, but in groups, in systems, under pressure. Then quantitative finance, because I wanted to understand markets, which are really just collective behavior with a price tag.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Now behavioral science, because after all that wandering, I realized the question I'd been circling was always the same:
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed pl-6 border-l-2 border-zinc-700 my-8">
        Why do people do what they do, and can we design around it?
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
        It looks scattered on paper. It didn't feel scattered. It felt like I kept leaving rooms because I couldn't find the question I was actually trying to answer.
      </p>

    <!-- Section: The Thinker Problem -->
    <section class="mb-20">

        <div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-zinc-700 to-transparent flex-1"></div>
        <h2 class="text-sm font-medium tracking-widest text-zinc-500 uppercase">The Thinker Problem</h2>
        <div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-l from-zinc-700 to-transparent flex-1"></div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's something I've had to make peace with: I am not an operator. I don't sustain execution at the level operators do. I see patterns, connections, the shape of things before they exist. But turning that into something real — the grind, the follow-through, the thousand small decisions — that's not where I live.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For years this felt like a deficiency. Everyone around me was shipping, scaling, grinding. I was thinking.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <span class="text-zinc-200 font-medium">Un-Dios</span> is my answer to that. Not by becoming an operator, but by finding a different way. I'm building an entire Android platform without writing a line of code myself — working through Claude, through AI agents, through whatever tools let me translate vision into artifact without pretending to be someone I'm not.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-500 leading-relaxed italic">
        Is it cheating? Maybe. Is it working? So far.

    <!-- Section: On Respect -->
    <section class="mb-20">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-4 mb-8">
        <div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-zinc-700 to-transparent flex-1"></div>
        <h2 class="text-sm font-medium tracking-widest text-zinc-500 uppercase">On Respect</h2>
        <div class="h-px bg-gradient-to-l from-zinc-700 to-transparent flex-1"></div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I used to think I wanted respect. That was the word I kept using. Respect over money. Respect over titles. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that "respect" was a stand-in for something else.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-5 gap-3 my-10">
        {['Safety', 'Visibility', 'Control', 'Autonomy', 'Justice'].map((word) => (
          <div class="bg-zinc-900 border border-zinc-800 rounded-lg px-4 py-3 text-center">
            <span class="text-sm text-zinc-300">{word}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        These five things, bundled together, looked like "respect" from the outside. But they're not the same thing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        More than any of that, though, what I want is to <span class="text-zinc-200">not be reduced</span>. Not flattened into someone else's category. Not mutated into a label that makes me easier to process.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
        Once I realized that, about 90% of my behavior made sense.

    <!-- Section: What I'm Actually Doing -->
    <section class="mb-20">

      </div>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I lead a research team at Glance. We work on lockscreens, smart TVs, ambient displays — the surfaces where attention is thin and design has to earn every second. I've helped ship products to millions of users across India, Japan, the US. I have patents on AI creative analysis, trust scoring systems, cognitive load management. I'm working on a doctorate about social comparison and network mobility.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But the thing I'm most interested in right now is <span class="text-zinc-200 font-medium">Un-Dios</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        It's an open convergence platform for Android. Think Ubuntu-style desktop experience meets Android's app ecosystem. Your phone becomes a real computer — terminal interface, window management, workspace switching — without needing a custom ROM or root access. Just an APK.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm building it because Samsung DeX exists and is locked to Samsung. Because Motorola Ready For exists and is locked to Motorola. Because I want the customization depth of Linux and the app ecosystem of Android and I don't want to ask anyone's permission to have both.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-500 leading-relaxed italic">
        It's also, if I'm honest, me proving to myself that a thinker can build.

        I am extraordinarily bad at networking. I know its value — after a certain point, everything is network. Where you live, what you eat, your next job, your kids' school. All of it. Decades of relationship-building, compounding quietly in the background.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I know this. I still don't do it. Something about it feels like wearing a costume that doesn't fit. I'd rather play devil's advocate in a real conversation than work a room. I'd rather write to strangers on the internet than collect LinkedIn connections.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Maybe that's a mistake. Probably it is. But I've accepted that I'm not going to out-network anyone, so I need to figure out my own thing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
        This site is part of that. Writing is part of that. Building in public, awkwardly, is part of that.
