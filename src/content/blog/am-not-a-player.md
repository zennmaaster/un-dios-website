I know, I know a lot of you are fuming right now. All of you thinking what a bastard, he is like the biggest player ever ( well I appreciate the sincere and hostile compliments). But the truth of the fact is, I am not a player.

I mean sure I was born to be a player, ( when you are a geminian its very difficult not to be one ) but what am trying to tell you is the fact that I choose not to be one. So i find it very disheartening when i find people calling me a player. Because I make every effort not to be one. I don't understand what vibes i send or carry along that people get such an absurd idea that am a player. I mean I would love to be a player, which guy wouldn't and knowing me I would quite flaunt this prowess with gay abandon. Am not against being told nice things which are not true, but then what truly madly deeply pisses me off is the fact that people think am a player and they keep on a look out for when am gonna make a move. Now for a person who doesn't know what works and what doesn't thats being a bit harsh, and its not like people tell me " dude what you did was awesome " but what i do get is, NOTHING.

I mean cmon, the reason anybody does anything is to be appreciated, if somebody is good at something appreciate him/her. Don fucking put a label on it. Fucking pissing off. Honestly.

Think me will go to japan and get those free hugs. And am gonna say this for the last time. I am not a player. I chose not to be. Even though I am one. There is a difference and if you cant spot it then go jump. =)
