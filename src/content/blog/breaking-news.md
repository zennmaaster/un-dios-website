Well I am going to keep this real short and simple. Submitted the synopsis, sample chapters and personal statement for the Bitmead Bursary. But what really has got me all excited and peeing me in knickers is the news that my application for the 110th TGC has been selected and I am expected to go to Allahabad for the interview. And if things go well, then boy, I have to tell you… anyway… Waiting for the damn call letter to arrive in me letter box now. 

 Now am sure that the excitement I am currently reeling is not going to come through in this post. But trust me… oh never mind… I can't think straight now…
