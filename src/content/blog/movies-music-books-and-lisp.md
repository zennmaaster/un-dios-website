I woke up about an hour back and decided that today is a good day to make a podcast. Even though I am not in the best of the moods courtesy crazy unreasonable woman. But here goes nothing. Listen to me talk about movies (Eagle, Source Code, Limitless, Rango, Star wars, Game and Paper moon), music (Mumford & Sons), Books (Ice Man, Tokyo Cancelled, Karl aaj aur kal), exciting new people (Mark Dark and Nutmeg) and telly (perfect couples, house, archer, chicago code and workaholics).
