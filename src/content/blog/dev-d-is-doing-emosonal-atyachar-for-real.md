So while I was busy saving the world, chatted up with Paresh who had to, I mean he really had a choice at not sharing the information which would not break the dam in my not so peaceful afternoon at office, but he had to. And so he did, and gave me the most heart breaking news one can receive on a Monday afternoon. That of an awaited movie being shelved, which means that the strains of ‘ek, do teen, char, cheeeee!’ will not see the light of day, and I would be till the end of my superhero life be stuck with a trailer of the movie lasting all of 2 minutes and 25 seconds, which after 38 repeats kind of loses its charm only to be put back on the loop for a million times in another 20 minutes. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, if you are feeling the emosonal atyachar just like me, please go on and tell Paresh to pull strings, talk with his once upon a time Neighbor and get the film rolling, I mean dint you guys see Lucky Singh in Lage Raho Munna Bhai. In the meantime, have I told you how awesome the song Superchor is, I now rechristen myself from superman to SuperChor. Been trying to get hold of the lyrics for quite some time now, but off-late the results of that search are in line with the new pattern emerging in my life checkered life (get it, pattern, checks, turning quite the wordsmith aren’t I…If only Shakespeare was not gay and was instead a Hot smoldering beauty with a brains, I would have requested my grave to be next to hers), the new pattern is that whatever I have been searching for with full on interest, I just don’t get it, maybe Om Shanti Om needs another screening or something. I mean I did not find the lyrics for Superchor, I could not download the song of Dev D, I could not find the lyrics for Dev D, Dev D is going to be shelved. 

Yes, I am a Superchor of very modest nature! BTW before you do the blasphemy and say who is this SuperChor, take a look at the video below. (The song is of the title track, download the superchor, transcribe the lyrics for me and mail it across will you, why? Because Old Monk is talking, talking, Johnny Walker is walking, walking)  



Last but not the least, my tribute to the genius of Dev D. 

A glowing tribute to the music in the genius words of Dev D himself – (In Hindi and English)

Ek, Do, Teen, Char, Cheeeeee (you have to really stretch this one)
Yeh dil piglake shaadi baneke, 
dadkhan ko abad bana loon,
smoking smoking nikle re dua,
seene mein hai jalti hai armaanon ki arthi,
arey why to tell you darling kya hua,
Tauba tera jalwa, tauba tera pyaar,
tauba tera emosonal atyachar,
[Full on wedding band baja]
arey tera emosonal atyachar,
Haan dhoka hai yeh dhoka, 
Dhoka tera pyaar, 
[Full on Rock Music]
tera emosonal Atyachar

Now, English translation for the illiterate ones,

1, 2, 3, 4, 6 ( you have to stretch on the ‘ix’ bit of 6)
Melting this heart, getting married,
Heartbeat may I populate,
Smoking, smoking comes smoke,
In chest burning desires pyre,
Oh! What to tell you Darling what happened,
Repent your charisma, repent your love,
Repent your Emosonal Torture (There is just no replacement for Emosonal)
[FULL ON WEDDING BAND Orchestra]
Yes Betrayal this is betrayal,
[FULL ON ROCK MUSIC]
Betrayal your love, your emosonal torture.
