Definite indicative signs that I am a prick and I am progressing to the becoming a prick of a higher dimension. One of my friends was generally talking to me about something he did and he felt good about and being the dick I am, acted a proper prick. Btw does that rhyme or is it just me losing it?

I donno why I have to be a jerk just for fuck's sake? And no that is not an open ended question. I know a million people have their own reasons as to why I act the way I do, ranging from my father, to all the girls I have been with, to why hiroshima and nagasaki were fucking nuked. Think, I know the answer. =) Thank you very much. And the Don has left the building.
