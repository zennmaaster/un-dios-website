I was browsing. As usual, when I came across this "http://bluebirdsinging.blogspot.com" blog where the woman had answered this questions. Not only was the blog funny, but it was also nostaligic in more ways than one. Bought back memories of filling up slam books not that I was a big fan of them or I am one, but you know the whole thing had its own kick as to who is offered their slam books to whom and so on and so forth. So here is my shot at it. With the permission of the author.
