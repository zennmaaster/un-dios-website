Came back from bombay. Still in one condtion, atleast the last time I checked. Well people suddenly revving up the speed the moment the enter the confines of the railway station still baffles me. So does the complete absence of auto wallas in south bombay. What was even more suprising was the usage of meters in both auto's and taxis. Coming from Delhi and Che(e)nai, this is suprising in the same league as me attending natures call, and also following the personal hygine routine all in the same day.

The trip was a total ball, loved the places i went esp HRC. Finally got to see the Gateway of india, though was irked by the presence of other people who couldn't sacrifice few minutes in the AC and have their coolers while i happily enjoyed my cancer stick. There was one funny story all thanks to me, finding the courage to walk up to a absolute bomb only to find she is a kid. She should be sued to have such a fine ass on her. But the majority of the jokes were on the ever funny " My Brother Nikhil ".

The one day when the entire gang was there and slept together ( in a non-gay way, in a spartan way ) was absolute funny, with funny repartees and laughs which would have put the wolves and the hyenas in the mountains nearby to shame. Same old stories with bit of new twists, new stories being formulated all so R-rated that it wouldn't do no justice to this blog.

Though there was some brother bonding too, from which movie makers who wanna make a movie about guys bonding in a non-gay way might wanna take a page or 2 from. The highlight definitely had to be the trip to the mall to watch the movie 300.

After the movie there were 5 guys screaming. " MADNESS ??? !!! THIS IS SPARTA !!! "

Well the 300 hangover is still being carried forward, so beware you making untoward comment or any action which will instigate the warrior. Am changing my name again. This time its called...

KING LEONIDAS.
