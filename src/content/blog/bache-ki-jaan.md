Facing exploitation at work... Bache ki jaan le rahen motherfuckers... AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!! will get back at them... not the one to take shit lying down...watch this space...\

ps: No am not fucking talking abt the kid in the picture... I am talking me here... I am too self obsessed to be talking about some random kids pic. The photo just adds weight as a tool to showcase how badly I am being exploited.
