It's hot. The walk around the garden hasn't helped me one bit. Maybe I should open that bottle of beer. Bah! It's 3 in the afternoon… Oh! Who is going to stop a 80 year old man from enjoying a sip of bitter? That's right… No one! I am the king of the world… hehehehe… 

 Would have been nice if Jasmine was still alive… Ah! Think about the whore and the breeze blows… Will probably get the carpenter take a look at this creaking sound coming from this rocking chair. Hehehehe… would be funny if it broke and I fell on my buttocks… 

 "Allo love…" that girl does have a nice smile. I hope she doesn't think I am sort of a pervert… Oh! Who am I kidding? I am a pervert… Pity women my age don't want to do anymore. Wonder what Marie is doing right now… screw that bitch! She left you at the altar… Hope she is dead and had a horrible marriage and her husband what's – his – name treated her like shit… She was a nice girl… Hope she didn't regret the choices she made… she never was a bright girl… she would have put up with that bastard just like she put up with me… Wonder what happened to… Fuck! It's raining… for once couldn't the breeze carry on but no! It has to fucking rain… 

 The house is so dark and silent… I miss Jasmine… She would have made me stub this cigarette… Good thing she left me for that poof Victor… Bastard! At least one thing I am proud of is that I never stole somebody's girl… Did I? Oh yeah! Yvonne… Wonder what happened to her… 

 "Shit shit shit! Nurse! Nurse! I seem to have shat myself again…" Fuck! Hate when this happens… I am not leaving a single penny for those bastards… Definitely not leaving them anything not after they fucking called the cops on me… They couldn't do shit could they? Nobody could have done anything to me… Not when I pleaded mentally insane… They all had to die… Jasmine had to die… So did Yvonne… And so did Marie… They all had to die… That's what they wanted… that's what they deserved… They couldn't just leave me and go… They promised to be with me forever and ever… And that's what they will do… That's what they will do… "NURSE!!!" she said she will never leave my side…
