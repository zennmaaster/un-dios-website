Well, that is exactly what it has been this past week. It was more soul crushing than the day I got lectured by that physics teach about how I will never be any good for anything and literally trash me and every single dream I dreamt off. There have so many things happening in the last week, that I don't even know where to begin. Let's just say that I am at the worst possible place right now in life and the worst part is that I don't know where I am headed towards. Life sucks at the moment and I need a bloody major distraction before I drive myself over the edge and with each passing day, the edge seems closer than ever.
