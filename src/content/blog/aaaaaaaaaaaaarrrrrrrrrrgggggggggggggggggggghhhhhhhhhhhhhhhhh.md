Terrible weekend. First I lose the keys to my apartment and then I have to jump from my neighbors balcony onto mine and then do a brilliant Thomas crown shit. This was on Saturday. On Sunday I forget a whole pack of smokes and a box matches while having coffee, that meant I couldn't have my customary morning smoke and coke, and then I get bullied by my narcissistic room-mates and their girl-friends, and then today morning I get mighty irritated by the jarring stupid ring-tone I have set at high volume and am already at nerves end, and its not even 10 in the morning yet. Focking Orrible....
