I'm through with standing in line,
to the clubs i'll never get in,
Its like the end of the tunnel,
and there is no sign of promised light,
This life hasn't turned out
quite the way I want it to be

Ask me: tell me what you want?

I want a couple of hundred brand new Apts,
Showcase them on an episode of cribs,
And a bathroom I can play football in
And a king size tub big enough
for ten plus me

ask me: yeah,so what you need?

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

I want a city named after me
stamps released with my face on it
And my name to be mentioned in the same breadth as sexy and hot,

so ask me: So how ya gonna do it?

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
with her bleach blonde hair
and well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free


I'm gonna dress my ass
with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion,
hell get a mansion better than that,
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
blow my money for me

so ask me: So how ya gonna do it?

I'm gonna trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
with her bleach blonde hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary
in today's who's who
We'll get you anything
with that evil smile
Everybody's got a
drug dealer on speed dial
well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna do those things
that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills
from a pez dispenser
Get washed-up greats to wash my laundry
And wear something new everyday

Well we all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
with her bleach blonde hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary
in today's who's who
We'll get you anything
with that evil smile
Everybody's got a
drug dealer on speed dial well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar.
