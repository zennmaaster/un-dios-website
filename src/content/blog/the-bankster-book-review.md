The Bankster by Ravi Subramanian is a story about
bank fraud, people mysteriously dying and somebody piecing together the puzzle,
connecting the dots and unveiling the big picture. The Bankster took me by
surprise. Given my despicable knowledge and attitude towards banks and its
inner machinations, the book threaded me along gently and carefully like a
surgeon pulling along a newborn by umbilical cord. 




So, the story starts off with the brief thing
about blood diamonds before quickly jumping into the office politics and double
crossing of Greater Boston something Bank. It is nicknamed as a more easy to
remember GB2. The story progresses with a galloping pace like gossip spreading
through unofficial communication channels. And you are soon beginning to
develop the feeling that something is not being done right. In the meantime,
you are also told this story of a boy who finds his father wrongly arrested for
suspected ivory smuggling. And this father, Krishna Menon, is later engaged in
a Anna Hazare styled demonstration against the government demanding answers.
These seemingly unconnected events are then tied together rather smartly albeit
hurriedly in the end through the story’s protagonist, Karan Punjabi. 



The most enjoyable aspect I enjoyed about this
story was Ravi Subramanian’s ability to show and not tell. It is a hard thing
to do, especially in a textual medium. The story follows a linear timeline with
action spread across couple of locations. The language is succinct and simple
and there are bits where Ravi Subramanian uses his character’s motivations to
explain things to the lowest common denominator, especially in the bits where he
unravels the twisted knots and kinks in the end. 



Though there were few things I wanted to better
understand about the story, which led me to google the story. One of the many
things which prompted the well crafted search string was the emergence of the ‘hero’
after the completion of 3/4th of the story. Turns out, The Bankster
is part of a series, and I am just assuming here, but I am hoping that the protagonist,
Karan Punjabi, was and is the protagonist in the series. The relationship
between recurring(?) characters are alluded subtly during the course of the
narration. This partly maybe the reason why I felt that some of the characters
didn’t really get the justice they demanded. There were few other characters
whose character motivations were uncharacteristic and required further
explanations.

          

           Would read the other books in the
series, probably not. Am I looking forward to the next book in the series? I am
not sure really. The story is good, fast paced (not in the way most of the book
jackets scream and claim to be), but I have not really been turned into a Wall
Street Journal junkie post reading this story. Sure, the premise of the story
revolves around banks and their workings and the characters and the rest of the
plot could have may as well been set up in a media house, FMCG or any other
vertical, but for some odd reason I didn’t find compelling reasons to root for any
of the characters. 

          

           But the most heartening things I
noticed was the clear lucidity in the story which catered to Indian audiences
and didn’t have dialogue translations to explain to a more cosmopolitan
audience.
