Hello
you-male-incumbent-potential-future-ignorant-regressive-khap-policy-makers,




Before I begin, let me first clarify as to why I
intend this letter to be both open and specific to Chennai Male Engineering
college students. It is open because you lot are, as they say in English,
idiots! I am also slightly inebriated at the moment, as they say in Tamil, I am
in full mabbu. The only reason, I am making this post specific to Chennai Male
Engineering students, because unfortunately I did my engineering in the city of
Chennai. This maybe largely generalized in content and scathingly rhetoric in
nature. I don’t expect you to comprehend most of things I embark on saying.
Consider this to be a very Aamir Khan starring Mangal Pandey where a lone
warrior foolishly wages war when the rest of his unit is smart enough to CYA*
(Cover Your Ass). I am well aware of this survival instinct which is prevalent
in you lot, I have been at the receiving end of it on many an occasion with my
own batchmates. Whom, I confess were credited with a lot more sense and balls
than they really had. 




Let me begin with addressing your contempt with
women who chose to wear clothes according to their wishes. If a woman wears a
pavadai – duppatta, she is a good Tamil girl, but if she chooses to replace the
pavadai with jeans, then she turns against the culture/kalacharam of Tamils? Agreed
that the state board syllabus doesn’t really include the concept of sex
education or enjoys page 137 of 9th standard CBSE science textbook,
chapter Life Process part II. But surely, your efforts of watching countless
hours of masala midnight on multiple channels vying to grab pre-pubescent
eyeballs, should have taught you, something if not all about sexuality. Now,
you may counter this to be a fault of the system, which I am led to presume
firmly believes in the fatal disease of cooties, should the girl and boy
students share the same air space. Why is it “cool!” for you machans to wear
low rise jeans and show your Gopal underwear and baniyans like it was the
national fucking flag? 




What gives you the impression that it is completely
okay, or as they say in Tamil, wokay, for
you armpit minge sweat piles to go brush against a woman renganathan theru and then later wank off in the comfort of your own
home? In what fucked hypocritical world is it wokay for your grandmother to fucking smoke bidis, not cigarettes
but bidis, but if a girl chooses to indulge in the same she is labeled a slut,
I reckon the word you bastards use is thevdiya.





The extremely popular and widely profitable Tamil
movie industry and you lot are engaged in a giant circle jerk which would put
the motherfucking London eye to shame as a spectacle. 









          

           Take this picture for instance, shared
by a bum bleaching batch mate of mine. It translates into, ‘What shouldn’t be covered is covered. But if
we pinch your  waist then you show
attitude.’. Are you motherfucking retarded? If you show your bum and
somebody sticks their manly bits in it, or posts a picture with you in your
lungi raised and comments about wanting to bum your best mate, would you be alright
with it? My guess is not. You ass cunting dyslexic TASMAC crowding chuths are a
bunch of a confused cum laden crustly wankholes, who want to boast about who
put an ‘omelet’/half boil, but if a woman partakes in enjoying a drink, it is
against Tamil kalacharam/culture? Aren’t you the same peniskneecaps who proudly
paint murals of Madurai Menakshi burning the entire city down in alcohol fueled
rage? (No woman I know gets angry enough to burn the whole city down without
couple of drinks down her gullet.)

          

            Just what the fuck do you
motherfucking cunts have against people exercising their free will? You
hypocritical saggy tit smuggling lungi fuckers… Just why the fuck do you have
double standards in all your dealings? Do you have lot have to be constantly
reminded about the fact that you are the same bunch of wankering cock guzzling sour
grape screaming retards who celebrate mother/amman/amma? Not to
mention that given the number of Engineering colleges present in the city of
Chennai invariably makes you a representative of MY country. And boy! is it a
shame for me to even acknowledge the fact that these vile thoughts run through
your minds when you look at another human being. 

          

              Lot of people say that India is a progressing
country, on its way to greatness, but when educated illiterate regressive fucks
like you are involuntarily handed over the badge of being an Indian citizen, I
have to clench my anal sphincter unenthusiastically, for fear of what act of
yours I have to defend the ever metamorphosing avatar of the global Indian. 

           

             Recently I met up two of my batch mates
from college. Both of them were extremely well off, both of them were grudgingly
content with their respective roles in the IT sector. Both of them proud wearers
of the pre-American Pie virgin badges. Their concern/apprehension was, will the
girl they marry according to their parent’s wishes be a virgin? It wasn’t if
the girl and the boy will be compatible, it wasn’t if the girl and the boy will
see eye to eye on deal breaking issues like religion/politics/child rearing philosophies.
No sire! It was, ‘is the girl a virgin?’. We are in the godfucking twenty first
fucking century. Are you telling me that you as a city and a community of
educated fucks are ALL bunch of omegas in the male hierarchy? Does this fear
and insecurity stem from your mother’s unsatisfied sexual appetite and your father’s
failure to be a man secure in his own sexuality? I have read enough Greek tragedies
and psychology books for me to recognize these insecurities when I see them on
display. But what is confounding is the fact that you would like to parade
these insecurities like it was a badge of honor, like an inside joke on public
forums like Facebook. Just how dumb are you? On a scale of a chuth to a 30 year
old cock still wanting to climb back into his mother’s vagina? 




Grow the fuck up! The world is ever changing.
Either learn how to change course while you remain seated on your moral high
horse or get trampled and die forever alone, you ungrateful ignorant bunch of
culturally bankrupt bum fuck starved shit holes!




With
a lot of hope and great prejudice,

Me
