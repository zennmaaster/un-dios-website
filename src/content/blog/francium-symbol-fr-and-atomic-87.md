Am feeling unstable right now. Mentally. Am more or less on a self-destruct mode, with the only thing holding me straight is my work. This is the most unstable I have ever felt. Feel like francium, think am going to decay into something I will never be able to recognize or bring it back to its original self. For the first time I find myself lost among my friends, partially because there ain't nobody at the moment, and the other being I cant enunciate what am going through right now.
