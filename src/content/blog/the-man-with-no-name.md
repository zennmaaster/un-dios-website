## Chapter 1

*1*

‘It was fun! Ladies night at Shalimar is always fun’ The girl
gushed as she swept the hair away from her face.

‘You are cute… I like
you’ her speech slurred with girly giggles as she leaned forward with pouted
lips and closed eyes.

‘You are drunk!’ The man pushed her to the side, careful enough to
not push her out of the moving autorickshaw. The autorickshaw driver looked in
the mirror over hanging over his forehead and grinned lecherously at the girl.

‘Madam fullu tight-ah?’ The driver chuckled as he mustered all
the English he knew into a comprehensible sentence. It was more a statement
than a question. The man ignored the driver and lit up a cigarette. He should
have left the girl alone. He should have gone back to the hotel. But the girl
was drunk, and people had seen him with her. He had considered his options.
Leaving her behind would ensure that people would remember the two of them long
enough to discuss them the next day over brunch. Taking her along meant that
people would remember the girl and not him. 

The auto driver continued alternating his gaze between the dimly
lit roads and the rearview mirror. With the wind blowing through the side of
the auto, the driver could see the side of the girl’s exposed breast as she
leaned against the foreigner’s shoulder. She was wearing one of those plastic
bras, the kinds which women wore under skimpy clothes when they visited discos.
The man was a foreigner, cropped hair along the sides, with the first traces of
stubble showing on his chin. All foreigners looked the same to him. They all
wanted the same things, women, booze and weed. They were all the same, paying
triple the amount of fare and never bargaining. 

‘Turn left! Turn left!’ The girl directed, suddenly waking up
from her alcohol induced haze. The auto driver followed as instructed. 

‘Stop! Stop!’ The girl tapped the driver’s shoulder. The auto
stopped in front of a big gated community. 

‘You want to come in?’ The girl invited the man, a leery smutty
smile pasted across her face as she stumbled out of the auto as she pulled her
skirt down. The watchman got off his chair and smiled as he watched the girl
stumble and saunter out of the auto. 

The man ignored the girl and tapped the auto driver to move. The
driver promptly followed the man’s directions.

‘Ladies, drinking firstuh then wanting sexuh. Bad no?’ The auto
driver commented. The man closed his eyes and leaned his head back, ignoring
the social commentary. 

‘Saar?’ The driver spoke in hushed tones. The auto had stopped
in the middle of nowhere. The man opened his eyes and looked around, it was no
place that the man recognized. The auto driver held a pen knife in his hands
and a humble smile on his face. 

‘Give money!’ The driver requested. The man raised his left ass
cheek off the seat. 

‘Slow… Knife sharpuh’ The driver informed. The man pulled out
his wallet and handed it to the driver. The driver pulled open the sleeves of
the wallet and pulled out the cash and the cards. 

‘Pin numberuh?’ 

‘4523’ The man replied. 

‘Phone? Watch? Chain?’ The driver motioned with the pen knife. The
man handed over the phone and removed his watch.

‘Now drop me home’ the man calmly replied. 

‘The chain!’ The driver demanded, his voice rising. 

‘No!’ The man responded, his eyebrows converged over his green
eyes underlining the monosyllable. 

‘Out!’ the driver directed with the knife. The man followed.
Right before the driver drove off, he gave a loud shrill whistle. As the man
mentally noted down the number plate, he heard rustling noises from behind him
and felt a sharp pain at the back of his head. The man fell down as a heap. He
felt the chain from around his neck being yanked hard. The man tried opening
his eyes, clouded by tears of pain, he saw another man hurriedly get inside the
auto before it sped away.

The morning office rush looked at the man with judgmental eyes.
The man stretched his back, the white t-shirt now blotted with splotches of
dried blood cracked away from his back. He gingerly touched the back of his
head and felt the matted hair clumped together. He looked around and found his
empty wallet flung to the side of the road. He looked down at his feet and
realized that somebody had stolen his shoes and socks. He bent down to pick the
wallet up and felt pain shooting down the side of his shoulders and back. He
dusted the wallet and put it back into his back pocket.

A generous middle aged commuter, overcome with a surge of
humanity stopped his bike and inquired if he could give the man a lift.

‘Fuck off!’ the man whinged. The commuter shook his head and
took off while hurling abuses at the man and his presumed country of origin.
The man picked up an old newspaper by the roadside, tore it up before folding
it and putting it inside his wallet. He walked till he reached the ring road.
He knew his way from here.




The early bird on his way to office stepped out of the ATM only
to find himself walking straight into a firang. He apologized and trashed the
ATM receipt. The Firang apologized as well and offered a handshake. The early
bird didn't mean to be rude. The firang stood in front of the solitary cash
dispensing machine as he watched the man he had just bumped into get on a bike
and merge with the traffic. He pulled out a wallet, it wasn’t his. He pulled
the driver’s license, the face on it was the same one as the man he had bumped
into. Instead of a wallet stuffed with sheaf of torn newspaper, he now had
three hundred odd rupees, a debit card and two credit cards. He folded the
money and pushed it down his front pocket. He pulled out crumpled receipts from
the trash can next to the ATM machine and placed them inside his new wallet.

He walked across the road to the tea shop.

‘Classic milds’ he pointed at the pack of cigarettes lined
neatly against the shelf with his chin.

He lit up the cigarette and pulled hard on it. He eyes read the
minute and the hour from the shopkeeper's wrist. Half past nine.

He walked as he puffed on the cigarette. There was one more ATM
down the road. Wallets were exchanged and this time it yielded a cool five
grand. He smiled as he thumbed the notes. Nobody suspects a foreigner.  

He made his way to the mall which had just opened its gate. The
security at the gate looked on suspiciously at this barefooted firang. He
walked through the gates, spread his hands as security waved the metal detector
wand around him. He climbed on the escalator and headed straight into the
restroom. He washed his face, combed his hair with his fingers and tucked in
his t-shirt. He walked into Lifestyle, quickly found the aisle with t-shirts
and shelves lined with jeans. He left his old clothes in the changing room and
walked out of the store. The employees were still getting their bearing around
in the morning.

He walked into McDonalds and placed an order for Hot cakes,
sausage egg muffin and a black coffee. He paid cash. Having done with his meal,
he lit up a cigarette. One of the employees came running in as the smoke
swirled up in the air from his nostrils.

‘No smoking sir!’ The employee pleaded. The man raised his
eyebrows, his lips enveloped around the cigarette butt as he pulled hard. The
employee stared as the paper burnt and the man’s chest swelled. The man got up
from his chair and pouted smoke in the poor underpaid employees’ face. He made
his way to the Adidas store, pulled a pair of size 11’s from the rack, a roll
of new black socks and handed the credit card to the store attendant. The name
on the card read, ‘Jaganathan Swami’. The store attendant didn’t notice, but
the cashier did.

‘Sir, what is your name?’ The cashier inquired.

‘What does it say on the card?’ The man replied as he watched
the female store attendant walk in through the door. The girl was late, but
when she saw the firang standing next to the cash counter, her flustered face
blushed.

The cashier didn’t care. The sale was approved. That’s all that
mattered. The man scribbled a signature on the merchant copy, picked up the
credit card and walked out.

He called out to an auto standing in the auto stand.

‘Shalimar’ The man gave the address.

‘300/-’ The auto driver replied. Firangs always meant easy
money. The man nodded and got in.

The auto weaved in and out of traffic. The auto driver
occasionally kept looking into the rear view mirror. The firang had spread his
legs, with one foot right on the driver’s seat. The driver didn’t say anything.
Not when he was getting 300/- for a fare which otherwise would have earned him
just 80/-.

‘Saar, Shalimar’ The driver stuck his head out of the auto and
pointed the hotel where the man and the girl had stumbled out of last night.

The man got of the auto and headed to where autos and radio
taxis stood waiting for patrons to step out of the hotel corridor.

‘Saar! Money?’ The auto driver called out from behind.

The man turned around, smiled, pulled out the wad of money. He
pulled out a fifty rupee note and thrust into the driver’s shirt pocket and
good naturedly slapped him on his cheek twice. This didn’t bode well with the
driver.

‘Two fifty more’ the driver pulled out the fifty rupee note with
his left hand from his pocket and caught hold of the man’s left hand with his
right. The man raised his right hand and brought it hard on the auto driver’s
cheek. The driver’s head banged against the side of the auto. The man turned
around and started walking towards the auto stand. The auto drivers, some
standing and some sitting and chatting watched the whole thing. Few of them
walked towards the man as he approached them. The auto driver who had just been
slapped was nursing his reddened cheek and hurling abuses in the native tongue.

‘KA 93 B 2304’ The man calmly mentioned the number plate.

‘What? What happened?’ An auto driver, fluent in English,
demanded to know as he pointed to the fellow angry auto driver behind the man.
The man turned his head and stared at the screaming auto driver. It was clear
that the auto driver was making threats about the man’s life and his family’s
well being. The man smiled and waved goodbye to him before turning his
attention to the auto driver who spoke English. The English speaking auto
driver was soon surrounded by fellow auto drivers.

‘I am searching for the auto driver who drives KA 93 B 2304’ The
man looked behind the crowd and saw the auto with the number plate he was
looking for.

‘Why? What you want? Why you slap him?’ The driver demanded to
know. 

The man pushed past the crowd and stood next to the auto which
had caught his attention.

‘Who is the driver of this auto?’ The man pulled out the pack of
cigarettes and tapped it on the back of his wrist.

The English speaking driver was losing patience. He slapped the
pack of cigarettes from the man’s hand.

‘I am asking you. You…’ The driver demanded and the chorus of
angry irate auto drivers grew louder, bringing the attention of the hotel
security.

As the driver was mid sentence, the man closed his fingers in a
fist and punched him straight in the Adam’s apple. Seeing this act of violence,
the other auto drivers jumped on the man. The man caught the index finger of
the first one who jumped on him and twisted it sideways. The second one found a
finger lodged deep in his left eye. The third felt a sharp kick to his knees
causing him to buckle down and fall. The fourth and fifth auto drivers who
wanted a piece of action were left two broken ribs and an ear bitten off.

The man stepped to the side and picked up his pack of
cigarettes. In all the chaos, somebody had stepped on the pack, he tsk-tsk’ed.
He pulled out a flattened out cigarette from the pack and searched his pocket
for a light.

‘Light?’ He signaled for a box of matches to the couple of auto
drivers who had held back, not wanting any trouble. One of the auto drivers
gingerly extended his hand with a lighter.

‘Thanks!’ The man smiled as he lit his cigarette and pocketed
the lighter. He pointed to the auto, ‘Who drove this auto last night?’

‘Prasanna’ One of them offered.

‘Where can I find him?’ The man questioned as he squinted his
eyes to avoid the smoke.

The drivers, who were still standing shook their heads,
murmuring to themselves as they looked at their comrades wincing and whining in
pain. Passerbys slowed their vehicles to take in the sight. The man was losing
patience. He stepped on the fellow with the broken knee and applied pressure.

‘Where can I find him?’

‘I don’t know… He was with Aleem’ the man cried out.

‘And where can I find Aleem?’ the man questioned as he lifted
his foot off the man’s knee and flicked the cigarette at him.

‘Shri Hari Lodge, Majestic’ One of the auto drivers reflexively
answered with fear. The man smiled as he walked and good humoredly slapped the
man on his back and got inside the auto. The auto drivers looked on at each
other, unsure of what to do.

‘Let’s go!’ The man urged as he slapped the side of the auto.

As the auto driver started his auto, he didn’t bother turning the
meter down. One of the other drivers hurriedly began to dial on his mobile
phone. The others rushed to the aid of their fallen comrades. The man stuck his
head out of the auto and looked at the man hurriedly speaking into the phone.



‘Tell him I want my chain back!’ The man yelled as the auto
driver merged into the traffic.

## Chapter 3

*3*





The moment the firang savari
stepped off the auto, the driver vroomed away to safety. 

The man pulled the last cigarette from the pack before crumpling
it and kicking it to the side. The sight of a Caucasian male in this part of
town was a rare one. Street urchins surrounded him begging him for food and
money, laughing and giggling all at the same time. Their empty curled fingers
pawed at him, appealing him to reach into his pocket with all them dollars. Few
of the kids even had some change clinking in their hands, giving him a
subliminal message. He looked at them, smiled before snatching the change from
them and kicked them away. The kids ran away screaming murder as he pocketed
the change, twelve rupees. 

The man made his way to the Shri Hari Lodge’s reception, manned
by an octogenarian with betel stained teeth and glasses perched on his nose
fashioned out of 1980s’ coke bottles. 

‘Aleem?’ he inquired pointing to the register on the table. 

‘200 rupees for an hour. No AC. No hot water. No credit card.
Only cash’ The old man recited the memorized spiel in chaste English as he
turned his head to search for a room with a key hanging on the board on the
wall. 

The old man searched for the appropriate key to hand over in
exchange for money. Just then, a burly looking dark man entered the lodge
through the main gate, followed by the coterie of kids. One of the kids tugged
at the big man’s tight shirt and pointed at the man who had dared raise a hand
on them. 

The man turned around to see what he imagined was a blinged out
water buffalo with a thick gold chain, earrings, long hair dyed a cringe
inducing blonde color with side burns thick as hotel mattresses. The old man
stopped his search and looked curiously over the Foreigner’s shoulder at the
big dark bundle of muscles dressed in gold. 

‘What happened Jasper?’
The old man inquired in Kannada as he watched the big man motioned to the kids
to disappear. Jasper ignored the big man’s question and brought his tree trunk
sized hand on the white man’s shoulder. 

Before the big man who resembled a gangsta water buffalo named
Jasper could begin his interrogation of what happened, the man reached out for
the earring dangling from the man’s ear and pulled hard. Skin tore. Earring came away. Pain dictated Jasper’s next
move as he let go of the man and clutched his bleeding ear. The Firang turned
around to pick up a paper weight placed atop the register and smashed it hard
against Jasper’s head. For added measure, the man kicked Jasper straight
between his legs. The big blonde colored water buffalo crumbled like
papier-mâché. The man turned his attention to the old man and repeated his
question, as he carefully placed the paper weight back to where he picked it up
from. 

‘Aleem?’

‘Third floor, room number 324’ The old man mumbled, his stare
transfixed on the bleeding Jasper. 

#

The man read the room numbers partially painted over atop the
doorway. 

#320… #321… #322… #323…

#324!

The man leaned against the door to listen in. A door on the
opposite end of the long corridor opened, a middle aged man exited and checked
his zipper. He sheepishly smiled at the Firang and gave him a thumbs up sign. The
Firang allowed himself a smile and a nod. He waited for his well wisher to head
towards the stair before placing his ears on the door. He could make out noises
emanating from the television and nothing else. 

He knocked on the door with his ears firmly planted on the door.
No response.  

He stepped back and studied the door. His body pressed hard
against the door, he felt the tension on the top and the middle. The door had
been double latched. He raised his foot and kicked it just hard enough to make
a booming noise. He heard the angry murmurs of a woman and the jangling jiggles
of her bangles. He heard the rustle of the human body getting off the bed and
the groan of disturbed sleep. He heard the top latch being slid down away, and
the latch in the middle being pulled to side. 

He stepped back, and this time kicked with all his might. The
door caught the wrist of the woman standing behind as it swung back with force.
She stood still, her face a curious mixture of surprise and pain. His palm
caught her cheeks, pushing her to the side. 

The room looked like a poster of debauchery, empty bottles of
booze, half smoked reefers, empty cigarette packs, half eaten foils of kebabs
and biryani. The Firang saw his phone laying atop the television set. He turned
around to see the man who had stuck him from behind last night, lying on the
bed naked and spent. The ruckus had woken him up from his stoned blissful
sleep. He stumbled around the room for cover yelling incomprehensibly in his
native tongue. The man took a deep breath as he walked over the television set
and picked up his phone. 

‘My chain’ The man spoke as he looked at Aleem’s blood red eyes
encased in puffy flesh. 

Aleem scrambled and pushed himself against the wall, hoping that
the wall open itself up magically, giving him room to run. 

The man didn’t understand what the naked guy said. So he mimed,
‘Chain’, ‘My chain, where is it?’.

‘No! No!’ is all Aleem could say. The man opened the bathroom
door and saw Oriental styled toilet, with a flimsy metal chain hanging off the
flush. He eyes caught sight of a wrench placed on top of the flush. He entered
the bathroom and jumped up to grab the wrench. Seeing this, Aleem found the
opportune moment he had been praying for. 

Aleem scrambled over the bed and headed for the door. The man
turned around, sensing that his prey was getting away from him, threw the
wrench at it. The wrench caught Aleem right in the middle of his back. Aleem
screamed in pain as he collapsed. 

The man walked over to Aleem, picking up the wrench and stood
over the winching and moaning figure of Aleem. 

‘Where is my chain?’ The man spoke clearly and softly, just loud
enough to put the fear of god in Aleem. 

‘No!’ Aleem cried as he violently shook his head. 

The man stood over the crouched Aleem, his knee pressing on
Aleem’s naked hairy chest, ‘My chain’. 

Aleem continued to cry and plead for mercy in his native tongue.
The man studied the wrench, rolling his thumb across the wheel opening the
wrench’s jaws. He placed his left hand over Aleem’s knee, straightening his
leg. His knee still pressing hard against Aleem’s chest. He raised the wrench
and brought it with all his might on his shin. Aleem screamed in pain. The man
let go of Aleem’s knee and repeated his statement posed as a question, ‘My
chain’.

Aleem cried and spoke hurriedly in his native tongue as clutched
his splinted shin in pain. The only thing the man caught was the name ‘Prasanna’.
The man pulled out his phone from his pocket and handed it to Aleem. 

‘Prasanna. Phone number. Address’ He directed Aleem with his
eyes, chin and the wrench held menacingly in his hand. Aleem hurriedly typed in
everything he knew. The man smiled as he pulled the phone away from his hand
and stood up. He walked over to the table with the weed and the half empty pack
of cigarettes. He lit a cigarette, walked over to where Aleem lay splayed on
the floor and kicked him repeatedly between his ribs before he walked out of
the room and closed the door behind him.

As the man made his way down, he found a big mob assembled. He saw
Jasper signaling a police constable at him. 

‘Oi! What the fuck do you
think you are doing?’ The constable queried authoritatively in the native
tongue. The man smiled as he pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and flicked
it at the constable before walking past him, pushing his way through the
assembled crowd. The constable caught hold of the man’s shirt. The man turned
around and stared at the clenched fist and into the constable’s eyes. 



‘I just want my chain back’ the man stated as he caught hold of
the constable’s wrist and applied pressure. The constable felt shooting pain,
his fingers let go of the man’s t-shirt. The man pulled the constable close to
him, studied his watch before giving him a full body search. The man pulled out
the constable’s wallet, pulled the money out of it and flung the empty wallet
on Jasper who still sat on the floor clutching his bleeding head.

## Chapter 4

*4*

     The man hailed an auto and directed him to
take him to Taj Windsor. The naïve and ignorant auto driver motioned the man to
get in and turned the meter down. 

The man paid the auto driver in full and walked through the
hotel gates. He walked over to the restaurant and ordered himself a steak with
extra sides of mash and veggies. He ordered for a coffee, black. He sipped on
his coffee leisurely. A tall man, dressed in a tailored suit and leather
patented shoes smiled at him as he made his way to his table. 

‘Where have you been? You
look like shit!’ The tall man spoke in Hebrew, and addressed the man like
friend who knew him since eternity. The man smiled, but the smile never reached
his eyes. Instinctively the man reached to feel the chain around his neck and
felt nothing but his skin. 

‘The Arab is in room 614’ The tall man confided in hushed tone
as he surveyed the half empty restaurant. The man nodded ever so slightly. ‘The
minister has given the go ahead. It has to be discreet.’ The man nodded again. 

‘I need new clothes, shoes and my rabbit’ The man spoke. The
tone of the request suggested it was more of a demand. 

‘Everything you need is there in room 647’. The tall man smiled
for appearances as he slid the room key to the man across the table. The man
motioned to the server for check, suggesting that he was done with his meal. 

‘And I need a set of wheels’ The man again made his request
sound like a demand. 

‘The flyaway is sorted.’ The tall man replied. 

‘I will make my own way back home. I have some personal business
to take care of.’ The man explained as he pushed his chair back and stood up. 

‘I will leave the keys at the front desk’ The tall man offered.



The server arrived with the bill, which the tall man signed for.

## Chapter 5

The man
swiped the keycard through the electronic slot and heard the whirring of the
lock opening up. He stepped inside and slid the keycard in the slot. The room
lit up. He saw the aluminum case resting on the bed. He opened the wardrobe and
saw the line of tailored suits, shirts still in their plastic covers with the
tag still hanging off them. He pulled open the drawers and smiled as he ran his
fingers over the rolled ties and boxes of cufflinks. He kicked off his shoes,
removed his socks, stripped and entered the bathroom. 

     As the hot water sprayed from the shower,
he watched the blood run down his body and swirl around the drain. He lifted
his head to feel the hot water fall on his face. The tears got swept away with
the hot water as his fingers circled his chest where the chain usually lay on
his neck. The place he had earmarked to tattoo the tombstone inscriptions of
his loved ones the day he retired. He turned the knobs, pulled the towels off
the shelf and dried himself. He walked barefoot to the bed where the aluminum
case rested. The case was protected with a three digit number lock. He turned
the dials and clicked open the case. 

He surveyed the contents, a capped syringe with Ricin, flashlight,
dissembled Berretta model 70 with .22 caliber long range bullets - the model
known around the world as the terminator used by the Mossad, with a spare
magazine and a digital camera with encrypted software for the man to send over
evidence of a job done to his superiors. The man quickly and efficiently assembled
the handgun and loaded the magazine. Having laid all the instruments of death
he would need in the next twenty minutes, he walked over to the wardrobe. 

Seven minutes later, he walked stealthy across the carpeted
corridor, as he screwed in the silencer over the muzzle of his Berretta. He
stood by the side of room 614 and knocked gently, just as room service would. In
his right hand he held the berretta and in his left he held the card key to the
room. He heard the muffled sounds of footsteps approaching the door. He could
feel the partial weight of a body leaning against the door to peer through the
peephole. This was the moment the man was waiting for. 

Two swift pulls of his index finger on the trigger. 

He quickly swiped the key card and pushed against the dead
weight behind the door. He hurriedly surveyed the room, the bathroom, the
balcony and the wardrobe. He found the laptop resting on the study table. He
flipped over the laptop, pulled a Philips screwdriver from inside his jacket
pocket and swiftly removed the hard disk from the laptop’s innards. 

He clicked the required pictures on the digital camera, logged
on the hotel Wi-Fi and sent them half across the world. 

He closed the door behind him and hung the ‘Do Not Disturb
Sign’. Intel suggested that his body wouldn’t be found till Thursday. 

The man put the safety on the gun, tucked it in his shoulder
holster and entered the elevator. 

He asked for the Hotel Concierge and instructed him where the
laptop hard disk needed to be delivered. He then collected the keys and the
valet ticket for his ride from the reception desk. 

He sighed and chuckled to himself as the valet bought the car to
gate. It was a dinky little car colored bright neon pink, which the locals
called as ‘Tata Nano’.

## Chapter 6

     The man checked the address twice before
punching in the address into the GPS. 

The female android voice prompted him the way. He diligently
followed the lefts, the rights and the straights, till he reached a road
impossible for any vehicle to traverse through. The android woman insisted on
heading straight for another 500 meters to reach destination. He found a spot
by the side of the road to park. He unclipped his seat belt, checked the gun and
the spare magazine. Pulled the phone of its holder on the dashboard, closed the
program with the android woman and stepped out. 

He stood out like a vestigial tail flopping around in the wind. Kids
playing cricket on the streets, men drinking tea and women gaily chatting
amongst themselves stopped themselves and stared at this abrupt interruption in
their routine. He walked to the group of men who held their cups of tea in
their hands and cigarettes hanging from their lips. He pulled the cigarette
from a man’s lips and shoved the phone screen in his line of sight. Residents
crept out of the crevices they called homes to look this creature. 

‘Prasanna?’ The man queried as he pulled hard on the cigarette. 

‘Prasanna?’ The man asked around his peers who sat next to him.

‘Auto driver!’ The man offered to clear their confusion.

‘Why? What do you want?
Tell me, you want women? Grass? Coke? Booze?’ The tea drinking, dhoti and
baniyan clad man gleefully inquired, sensing quick money from the skin tone and
the cut of the suit as he handed the phone back 

The man pulled out the tin lid covering the glass jar filled
with biscuits to go with the tea and smacked it hard against the man’s cheek. 

‘Prasanna, auto driver. Where?’ The man repeated his question as
he shoved the phone back into the man’s hand.

The man pointed in the general direction. The man smiled as
placed the lid back over the glass jar and pocketed his phone. 

The man found the kids who till moments ago were engrossed in a
game of street cricket helping him with directions as they ran and cleared the
path for him. One of the kids ran into the house and called out to his mother. 

‘Amma! Amma! Some white
fellow is looking for appa!’ The boy yelled as he tugged at his mother’s
nighty. The woman annoyed at this misplaced excitement slapped the kid to
settle down. 

The man bent down and entered the low doorway. He saw the kid
smiling and hiding behind his mother. 

‘Prasanna?’ The man questioned.

‘Eh! Who are you? Get out!’
the woman admonished the man for having entered her sanctum Sanctorum. The man
ignored the woman’s hysterical shrieks and looked around the small confined
space. His eyes found what he was looking for. A cheap family portrait taken
right after the kid was born in a studio framed in a garish frame surrounded by
stickers of Mickey and Minnie mouse. There staring at him was the smiling face
of Prasanna. 

‘Get out before I call my
husband!’ the woman shrieked as she searched around for things which she
could use for defense and attack this intruder. She found a steel ladle in the
kitchen. The man picked up the family photo and studied it with intent. The
years had not been kind to Prasanna. 

The wife came charging at him, waving the ladle threateningly.
The man turned and slapped the woman hard, cutting the inside of her cheek
against her teeth. The boy hid himself behind the wall. 

‘Your husband?’ The man pointed at the family portrait. The
woman nodded as tears rolled down her eyes, wiping the blood from the corner of
her mouth. A huge crowd stood outside the small one bedroom kitchen set up,
witnessing everything that transpired. Nobody stepped forward or exercised
their vocal chords.

‘Your husband… Where is he?’ The man questioned, with
appropriate hand gestures for the woman to understand. 

‘I don’t know! I haven’t
seen him for the last two days’ the woman wailed, ‘What has that demon brought upon me now?’

     The man looked around the room, his eyes
rested on a pencil and a notebook. He penciled in his number and thrust it
towards the woman.

‘Your husband. Call me! Urgent. Understand?’ The man spoke as he
saw the woman study his handwriting. He ventured into the kitchen, rumbled
around till he found a pair of scissors. He caught hold of the woman’s hair
from behind and turned her head around so that she could see his green flaming
eyes. 

‘Do you understand?’ He questioned again as he snipped the
scissors in the air. The woman nodded as she wet her nighty, a puddle of piss
streaming towards the doorway. He let go of her hair and she dropped on the
floor in shame and despair. He pocketed the happy family portrait.

The crowd parted the way Moses parted the red sea, as he stepped
out of the house and made his way back to the car. Nobody wanted to mess with
an insane white man. Dealing with their own kind was more than enough.

## Chapters 7-8

*7* 

Nothing prompts a man to act than the caustic words of a woman
questioning his manhood and threatening to take away his son. 

Phones had been ringing all through the day. The brotherhood of
auto drivers had been on the man’s tail through the day. Information was
collated and passed on. It was no longer a question of price as it was a
question of pride and respect. 

The man stopped the car at wine shop, purchased a quart of vodka
and got back inside. The day had been long and tiring. He navigated the traffic
and made his way to the apartment leased under the dubious name, David Davidar.
A name different from the one he used to enter the country, Frederic Raphael. A
name different from the one he will use to exit the country, Joshua Ferris.
Names he had seen on book covers, books he had no interest in reading. The only
things he read now were letters he kept locked in a safe box back in Leumi Bank,
letters written by his wife and kids.

The driver stopped the auto by the side of the road and made the
call, people had been waiting for all day. 

The man opened the door, switched on the lights, opened the
freezer, pushed the bottle of Vodka in, pulled out a frozen bag of peas and
placed it over the back of his head. He found the remote for the iPod player
and played the music as he pulled out off the tie off his neck and proceeded
towards the bathroom for another shower. 

‘Is he alone?’ The
voice over the phone wanted to confirm.

‘The lights were off
before he went in. He switched on the lights…’ The auto driver commented
all that he saw. Little money went a long way. The guard had been more than
happy to cooperate when the crisp pink and orange colored thousand rupee note was
crisply snapped in front of his face. 

‘Keep watching. Will be
there in another 10 minutes’ the voice on the other end of the phone
ordered before hanging up. 

The auto driver and the watchman of the gated community spoke in
the language of the migrants, Hindi. 

‘What did he do?’ The
watchman inquired, wanting gossip to share with his drinking buddies. 

‘Not sure, but whatever he
did, he is going to pay for it. Big time’ the auto driver smiled knowingly.


‘Where are you from?’
The auto driver inquired. 

‘Nepal!’ The watchman
proudly proclaimed. 

‘My wife’s brother’s
friend went to Nepal once. Said you could buy a kilo of Ganja for two hundred
rupees’

‘You get everything in
Nepal.’ The watchman offered a beedi to the driver, the driver shook his
head. 

‘Then why the fuck did you
have to come to Bangalore?’ The auto driver demanded, as the watchman lit
up his beedi. 

‘No jobs there. Full politics.
Full violence there. Wife’s sister works in Indira Nagar. She said you get paid
five thousand rupees a month just to walk a dog twice, once in the morning and
once in the evening. So we moved’ The watchman narrated the story of his
life between hard pulls on the rolled up tobacco leaf. 

‘I don’t understand how
wives know so much about the world even though it is us men going out and
working and earning money for the family’ The auto driver lamented. 

‘You have TV and cable
connection?’ The watchman inquired. 

‘Got it in dowry’ The
auto driver answered.

‘That’s how! See, we men,
what do we do?’ The watchman waited for the auto driver to answer to his
rhetoric question. The driver kept quiet, waiting for the watchman to explain
further. 

‘We men, we go out, we see
the world, we try and see where we can earn enough money so that the stove
keeps burning and how we can get a drink or smoke and forget about all the
stupid boring things that we do through the day. Like I can’t go to sleep
without drinking a quarter of rum every day.’ The watchman pulled hard on
the beedi before dropping it down on the tar road and twisting out the burning
embers with his toe. 

‘But my wife, she goes and
washes vessels in all this big, big peoples’ house. She talks to the big madams
and their children. And they keep watching TV or doing things on the computer.
Then she comes home, cooks for the kids and watches serials. And when I come
home, she tells me that the kids don’t have eggs with toys in them. The cable
bill has to be paid. I shouldn’t drink so much. I should act more like the big
people. And seeing me, the kids will also act like that and we can move up in
society. We don’t care for such things. What we need is a warm body and enough
booze to let us sleep in peace. Women, even they don’t know what they need’
the watchman explained. 

The two men shared a moment of silence. Only to be broken by the
loud rat-ta-tat sounds of four-stroke CNG engines of autorickshaws. 

The English speaking auto driver got off his auto. His neck
wrapped around with a foamy skin colored brace. The dangerous looking men got
off the other four autos. The other auto drivers were in a worse condition that
the English speaking one. One auto driver even had a crutch to support himself,
his leg taped up with makeshift sticks and heavily bandaged together. The goons
threw their pre-mixed bottles of cheap whisky and mineral water down by the
side of the road. They were ready for some action. 

‘Where?’ The English speaking auto driver inquired, his
question, more a threat than a question. 

‘Third Floor, Apartment 3A’ The watchman answered, his mind
racing for an excuse to account for his absence when things got hairy. 

‘Anybody come in or go out?’ The English speaking auto driver
interrogated the chatty auto driver. 

‘No!’ The driver answered, his head shaking vehemently to
support his statement. 










*8*

‘Hospital! NOW!’ Somebody
yelled as the autos were hurriedly started, broken bleeding bodies hauled
themselves in as they scampered into the traffic. 

The inside of Apartment 3A looked like a crash site. Broken
glass, furniture littered the marble floors with blood splayed across the
walls. The man lay on the floor clutching his sides. His face bruised and cut. He
pulled himself off the ground and trundled with great effort into the bathroom
to take a look in the mirror to ascertain the extent of his injuries. He knew
if he didn’t close the opening in his gut, he would bleed and die in the next
seven minutes. He shoved the tube of toothpaste between his teeth to clamp down
on as he gingerly pushed his index finger inside the bleeding wound. He
remembered his battalion commanding officer’s words at the end of his long first
day at training camp.

‘Pain is your ally. Pain is going to be your one true friend
for the rest of your life. Pain is
going to be that motherfucking whore son of a bitch who is going to tell you
when to call it quits. Eighty Nine percent of you numbskulls are going to fail
this program. It’s a fact. Out of the remaining eleven percent, only two will
get selected to mount missions on their own. I am looking for just two men, two
men who will treat pain like it’s their first pubescent orgasm. Two men who
will grin and clap their hands when pain
presents itself like a nymphomaniacal whore in Manila tripping on ‘shrooms
begging for your cocks. Because gentlemen!’ The instructor paused for dramatic
effect, his eyes sweeping up and down on the uniform rise and fall of his
troops up and down, while screaming the push up count. 

‘Because if you are feeling pain,
it means you are still alive and you should be happy! And I want to see smiles
on your ugly faces’ The instructor barked. 

The man grinned as his fingers felt around the gooey mess that was
his innards. He tried hard to keep his eyes open even as he slumped on the
floor, to conserve energy. His eyes vaguely made out the plastic box of dental
floss. If he could just reach it, without letting his index finger moving from
the open artery, he still had a chance. He tried pulling himself up, using the
washbasin for support. 



The washbasin broke. Water sprayed. He lay on the wet floor, unconscious.

## Chapter 9

‘Move! Move! Move!’
The instructor screamed into the megaphone as the recruits whinged and crawled
their way under the barbed wire with live fire going whizzing past their heads.


‘Remember this sound! This is the sound of AK-47! This is the
weapon of choice of your enemies, of our enemies. And it makes a very distinctive sound.’ The instructor
yelled as he watched one of the recruits duck to avoid getting his head blown
off. 

Yvet looked over his shoulder and looked at his buddy and smiled
his gleeful smile. 

‘You watch my six!’ Yvet grunted. The man grinned, showcasing
his white teeth before the instructor kicked dirty water over the two.

‘Move! Move! Move!’

The two men trudged forward on their fours in water, mud and pig
guts strewn over the barbed wires, to replicate human fatalities. 

The man opened his eyes. The ceiling didn’t look familiar; neither
did the smell of the place. It wasn’t a hospital - the smell was too floral and
homely to be a hospital or a clinic. 

‘Mummma!’ the man
heard a shrill young boy’s voice ring out close to him and the sound of soft
skin on the boys’ feet flopping stupidly over the marble floors. 

The man tried turning his head around, but it hurt. He ran his
hands over his torso, to gauge the extent of the damage. He was shirtless, his
wound heavily bandaged. 

His eyes rested on the flat screen television set and the
souvenirs resting on top of it. Owl figurines, toy airplanes and a digital
photo display. The pictures changed every five seconds. The pictures showed a
happy family of three – Serious looking husband with a severe case of receding
hairline, a pretty looking wife and a young boisterous son aged seven or eight.
The sunlight 

‘Ah! You are awake!’ The male voice boomed. The man saw a
balloon dressed in khaki walking towards his cone of vision. 

‘Dr. Sinha was fearing that you might die on her couch.’ The pot
bellied man dressed in Khaki with the three stars on his lapel suggested that
he was the man in charge, the fact that he spoke in what could be construed as
English and was followed by the woman in the photos with a young boy in tow underlined
the man’s suspicion. The woman and the boy kept their distance from the man and
stayed plenty of feet behind the Inspector.

The man blinked as he grunted while trying to pull himself up
against the armrest of the couch. 

‘Shivu go inside!’ He heard the woman instruct the young boy. The
boy held on tightly to the woman’s beige pants. From the look of the woman, she
didn’t seem like she had any sleep in the last thirty six hours. The skin
around her eyes was tight and dry. 

‘The boy was the one who reported the flooding in your flat. He
was also the one who found you bleeding on the bathroom floor’ the inspector
explained, flashing his eyes. The man mentally took note of the name on the
badge, ‘Hemant Gowda’. 

‘Madam, if you could go
inside, I would like to take his statement’ the inspector motioned to the
woman and the boy towards their bedroom, breaking into his native tongue. The
woman caught hold of the boy’s hand and turned her back on the man. The boy
craned his neck and smiled an innocent smile which he found the man returning. 

Inspector Hemant Gowda pulled forward one of the settees and sat
at the edge of it. He surveyed the naked torso and the bloodied pants of the
man laying on the couch. 

‘You know, I have been hearing reports all day yesterday of some
foreigner with green eyes, thin lips, short cropped hair asking about some
stupid chain has been walking around and making a mess in my city.’ The
inspector lowered his voice as he looked over his shoulders to ensure that Dr.
Sinha and her son were away from earshot. 

The inspector held out a maroon colored passport with the emblem
of three lions and the British monarchy’s crown etched over its crown. If the
man was smiling, his lips or his face didn’t show. It was clear that the cops
had searched his place, but hadn’t found his stash of passports and emergency
money stowed away behind the geyser in the bathroom. 

‘Mr. Smith?’ The inspector studied the photograph glued inside
the passport with skepticism. 

‘I am sure that you are not going to be placing a complaint, nor
are you going to aid us in our investigation to find out who was behind this
dastardly attack. And I can bet that you wouldn’t know anything about this gun
we found in your apartment either’ The inspector’s voice was low and
conspiratorial, to avoid the accidental eavesdropping by Dr. Sinha. 

‘I don’t know what you are talking about officer’ The man
grunted as he clutched the bandaged wound on his gut.

‘You know, I knew you would say something like that. They show
Hollywood movies dubbed in Kannada you know’ the inspector grinned glibly. ‘You
know that auto driver you met yesterday?’ The inspector looked keenly the man’s
face for any signs of recognition. There was none. 

‘He would have been the one who spoke in English? Rajshekar?’
The inspector added, till his found the expression what he was looking for -
dilated pupils and the ever so slight twitch of the eyebrows. 

The inspector smiled before continuing, ‘He told me that he
would be doing something stupid like this before he barged in with his men like
some idiot. And when I asked him if he was stupid enough to leave behind a gun,
he said that it was you who kneecapped two of his men before they got the
better of you. Now, I can arrest you for that, but it brings too much
attention. You will call your embassy and then the media will be involved. And
the paper work… yabba! So much paper
work’ 

The man raised his eyebrows, but looked on with a blank
expression pasted on his face. 

‘You see that ninety percent of autos in this city are owned by
people like me and my bosses. So anything that happens to the drivers, then it
becomes a personal matter.’ The inspector placed his hand over the man’s torso.
The heel of his palm pressing hard over the blood stained gauze. The man winced
as his neural pathways ignited with pain. The man grinned, which surprised the
inspector.

‘You see you owe me and my men seventy thousand rupees. Let us
just for damages’ The inspector took off his hand and wiped it on the bedsheet
covering the man. ‘I wouldn’t be making this demand if I had found money
stashed in your apartment. But we didn’t. And that puts me in a very awkward
position.’ The inspector continued as he pulled up the bedsheet and covered the
man’s bandages. ‘I will keep your passport for safekeeping, Mr. Smith, you
shall get it back once you have repaid the money you owe me and apologized to
my men. And with regards to the matter of the chain you been searching, I
wouldn’t be so hopeful. In all likelihood, it would have been pawned off and
then sold off. So you better call whoever you have to call to get me my money.
You understand?’ The inspector concluded as he pushed back the settee and stood
up, extending his hand with his visiting card. The man took the card and
nodded. The inspector motioned to one of the constables to bring out Dr. Sinha
and her son. The man nodded in response to the inspector’s implicit threat. 

The man smiled at the boy who followed behind his mother. The
boy reminded the man of the picture which was ensconced in one half of locket
hanging on the gold chain. 

‘Thank you Madam!’ The inspector spread his fat cheeks and
contorted it to resemble a smile. ‘You really should have allowed Mr. Smith to
be admitted to a hospital’. 

‘It’s okay. I am just glad that he is alive.’ Dr. Sinha smiled
feebly as she clutched her son’s shoulders tightly. With the awkward weight of
silence hanging in the room, Inspector Hemant Gowda ushered his constable to vacate
the premise. 

‘Will call you soon with updates Mr. Smith’ The inspector called
out as he stood outside the door. The man was sitting on the couch by now. There
were questions he wanted answers to and he couldn’t ask them with the cop
standing in front of the doorway with the glib smile pasted on his face.

## Chapter 10

*10*

‘I am sorry about all this’ The man spoke as the woman turned
around after closing the main door behind her. 

‘Shivu go and get ready for school’ The woman ignored the man
and instructed her son. 

‘Mumma! It is Sunday’ The boy rolled his eyes as he admonished
his mother, before running to place his young behind on the settee and grabbed
the TV remote. He punched buttons on the remote and Ninja Hatori came on the
screen. 

‘How long was I out?’ The man questioned as he tried standing up
on his feet, with the bedsheet clutched around his waist. The woman walked to
the kitchen ignoring the man. The man stretched and took support of the couch
and the dining table as he followed her into the kitchen.

‘I didn’t mean to cause you guys any trouble. I will be out
soon. As soon as I figure out where my shirt is’ The man explained. The woman opened
the fridge and pulled out six eggs. She loudly plopped the skillet on top of
the stove, yelled to her son from the kitchen. 

‘Shivu, what eggs do you want?’

‘Kacha-mucha’ the boy
yelled back. 

‘You fine with scrambled eggs?’ The woman looked at the man for
the very first time. She stared at him with deep disdain. 

‘Yes. Thank you!’ The man smiled. 

‘Go into the bedroom, you will find shirts hanging in the
cupboard on your left.’ The woman instructed as she pointed the way. As the man
made his way towards the pointed direction, the woman spoke again. ‘I hope you
are out after breakfast.’ The man nodded his head. 

‘Switch off the TV! Come and have breakfast’ The woman ordered
her son. The man sat down opposite the boy, dressed in a pair of jeans which
was a size too big for him and a pale blue shirt cinched together with a
leather belt. 

‘The whole floor was flooded.’ The boy exclaimed looking
excitedly at the man. ‘Water, water everywhere…’ He boy sang as he picked up
toasts from the tray onto his plate. 

‘What’s your name?’ The man smiled looking at the boy. 

‘Shiv Shankar, but everybody calls me Shivu’ The boy grinned as
he stuffed his face with scrambled eggs and toast. 

‘Close your mouth and eat’ The mother admonished.

‘How long was I out for?’ The man gingerly raised the subject
again, softly enough for Shivu to ignore the adult talk. 

‘Thirteen hours. I think I need to apologize to you. I am vet
and I don’t do humans. I am afraid that I may not have done a good a job. You
might want to go to a hospital and get it redone.’ The woman spoke hurriedly
avoiding the man’s searching green eyes. 

‘It is good that Shivu came and saved me.’ The man smiled as he
gave the young boy a conspiratorial wink. 

The man pushed his plate away and sighed. 

‘Thank you for breakfast and everything else.’ The man pointed
to his shirt, ‘I will get out of your way now.’ The man declared as he sipped
the last of his orange juice. 

‘If you need anything, let me know’ the woman offered with a
weak smile as she held the main door open for him. 

‘Mumma? Why is he wearing dada’s shirt? Will he return it?’ The
boy inquired as he plonked himself in front of the television set again. 

‘Bye shivu!’ The man waved, ‘And yes, I will bring back dada’s
shirt’ the man grinned before awkwardly turning his back. 

The man gently pushed open the door and heard the door sweep the
broken glass behind it. 

#

     He heard the door bell ring. He turned the
water off, he loosely wrapped a towel around his waist. He pulled the gun from
the shoulder holster hanging behind the bathroom door, he checked the magazine
and the silencer. He quickly walked to the door. He looked through the peep
hole and saw nothing. The door bell rang again. He put the chain latch in its
place, pulled the safety off his gun. He heard the rustling of cloth against
the door and wall. He opened the door ever so slightly when somebody kicked the
door. The chain latch did its job. But there were too many hands with makeshift
swords and iron rods. 

     Zffft!


The first shot caught an eager man trying to push his way past
the door in the knee. 

The chain latch gave away. A sea of bodies tumbled in. 

Zffft!

The second shot caught another assailant in his shoulder. A rod
swung high in the air and caught the man on his shoulder, forcing him to drop
the gun. Reflexes took over. His fist moved through the air, catching somebody
right in the solar plexus, his heel catching somebody in the neck. Things were
hurled. Flesh was pounded. Bones and fragile objects were shattered. But the
chaotic flaying about of sharp objects was intense. A sword cut through the
flesh on his arm, a sickle sliced through his shoulders and an iron rod found
itself deep in his guts. 

#

     The man quickly walked to the bedroom,
pulled out a new white t-shirt, jeans, fresh socks and slipped on his vans
sneakers. He jumped and pulled out the taped plastic bag from behind the geyser
in the bathroom. He quickly counted the stack of money and pushed it back
inside the plastic bag. He pulled out a red passport, his gateway identity, the
color synonymous with the country – Swiss Red. He stuck his hand inside the
plastic bag one last time and pulled a switchblade and a brass knuckle. He slid
the knife in his socks and stashed the brass knuckle in his jean’s pocket. 

     He stepped out of the apartment complex,
crossed the road and bought two packs of classic milds from the pan shop. He
lit a cigarette as he waited for change and scanned the road from behind his
aviators. He saw the nondescript Tata-Indica waiting on the corner of the road,
leaning on it, two plainclothes men wearing khaki shoes. He smiled and waved at
them. The two plain-clothed policemen ignored him. He chuckled to himself. 

     As he stood pulling hard on the cigarette,
he weighed in his options. He couldn’t take the nano, not because of its garish
color, but because using it would lead them to connect the vehicle with the
dead Hamas body back at the hotel. Taking an auto meant going around with a
giant target painted on his back. He stretched his back and winced at the pain
around his gut. He felt the soft spongey feeling of the bandage underneath his
t-shirt. 

‘Hello!’ he heard a
voice yell at him from across the road. 

He saw Shivu waving at him as his mother steered the car to a
stop outside the apartment’s main gate. The man jogged his way to the car. 

‘Should I drop you somewhere? The hospital perhaps?’ Dr. Sinha
inquired as she looked at her son smiling gleefully at the man, whose name she
hadn’t bothered to inquire yet. All she knew was that Shivu had dragged her
down the stairs and pointed to the water flooding out of the bathroom from
Apartment 3A. She saw the wreckage and stepped gingerly into the room while she
instructed Shivu to go down and call the watchman. When she saw the naked man
laying on the floor, his finger stuck deep inside his gut, with blood trickling
down. The many years of medical training and practice kicked in. She called out
to Shivu to go fetch her medical bag and instructed the watchman to call the
cops and an ambulance. The watchman stood watching perplexedly at the woman
deftly wipe and clean the wound before sticking the thread in the eye of the
needle. 

The woman called out to the watchman to help her lift him. The
two of them struggled to carry the man into the lift and drag him on the
woman’s couch. The young boy kept his distance while excitedly looking on at
what his mother did. 

‘That would be great!’ The man hurriedly got to the other side
of the car and got in. As he buckled in his seat belt, and a moment of thought,
he added ‘Only if am not imposing on you’, The man smiled. 

‘You were naked yesterday!’ Shivu exclaimed as he burst into a
fit of giggles. The man turned around and smiled at the young boy. His eyes
were glued on the Tata-Indica as the two men got inside and instructed the driver
to follow the Honda City.

## Chapters 11-15

*11*

‘Sir he is going with that
woman and her son’ The constable reported over the phone. 

‘Keep following him. There
is something really fishy about that gora. Keep me informed every half an hour’ Inspector Hemant Gowda
instructed before hanging up. 

The inspector’s eyes glanced from Mr. Smith’s passport and impatiently
waited for the screen to show the place where he would enter his password, one
character at a time. But all he stared was the annoying bar flashing ever so
slowly with the colorful words, ‘Windows 98’ spelled out in block letters. Inspector
Hemant Gowda flipped through the passport and found that multiple pages had
been stamped. Thailand, Greece, Spain, Bolivia. Mr. Smith seemed like a
globetrotter. He wondered what was so great about the chain which this man was
so keen on reacquiring. He had informed Rajshekar to track down Prasanna
Gundappa and ensure that he got hold of this dastard chain that the firang
seemed so keen on. 

He had to keep things low and quiet. If the news spread about
some marauding foreigner on the streets of Bangalore then the media circus
would effectively end not just Hemant’s career. He also didn’t want Rajshekar
calling up Vishwa Anna. He wanted to wrap things up neatly. He shuddered at the
thought of Vishwa Anna. 

Vishwa Anna had been a small time goon fifteen years ago. Some
ambitious, quick thinking and brutal violence soon saw Vishwa Anna not only
holding the post of a MP, but also substantial prime real estate around
Commercial street and Hebbal. For the last two terms, he had stood uncontested
from the Hennur Taluk. The money, the women, the power, the many children he
had fathered over the years or the multiple cases of murder, rape, corruption had
dimed the man’s bloodlust. Nothing got him excited than getting his fat fingers
wrapped around the handle of a sickle. Nothing got a smile on the man’s face
than watching the last breath leave a man’s mangled bloodied body. Vishwa Anna
was a man you met before you knocked on the gates of heaven or hell. A man,
Inspector Hemant Gowda wanted to avoid at all costs. It had been a good thing
that Rajshekar had informed him about what he was planning on. But how was he
to know that the stupid fuck was going to go around chopping a foreigner. 

He had been smart enough to put two men on the gora’s tail even
before he visited the hospital where Rajshekar and his men were admitted. The
doctor on duty informed him that two men were still fighting for their life. Among
those who were lucky to be still breathing, albeit with great difficulty. The
litany of injuries ran for miles - broken larynx, ruptured knee cap, multiple
broken bones, multiple cuts and abrasions. One was paralyzed from the neck
down. The inspector had stopped listening midway while the doctor continued
narrating from the thick wad of papers he held clutched in his hands. 

‘Look saar! Look!’ Rajshekar
beseeched the inspector. It was faintly comical as grown men winced and moaned
on the metal hospital bed. 

‘Tell Prasanna to come
meet me. And he better have this stupid bracelet with him’ The inspector
bent down and whispered his instructions into Rajshekar’s ear.

‘Chain saar!’
Rajshekar corrected the inspector. The inspector’s eyes narrowed sinisterly. 

‘And if I get to know that
Vishwa Anna knows about this then god help you and your newly wedded wife. I
hear she likes fried fish and expensive whisky.’ The inspector smiled to
offset the threat in his voice. 

‘Sir! He got off at
Mallaya Hospital. The woman and her kid have gone’ The constable informed
the inspector. 

‘Forget the woman and the kid.
Keep your eyes on him’ The inspector instructed. 

The man had waved Shivu and his mother goodbye. He noticed the
Tata-Indica stopping few cars behind them. He quickly turned and entered the
hospital reception. The two constables followed him inside. He slowed his walk
for them to notice that he took the fire exit. The man quickly climbed up the
stairs, followed loudly by the out of shape pot bellied men. Having climbed five
floors, the man stopped and hid himself behind a column jutting out of the wall.
The men stopped below to catch their breath, each urging the other to hurry up.
The man rolled his eyes as he waited for his tail and checked his watch. 

One constable stopped and turned, waiting for his partner to
catch up with him. ‘Where do you think he is running to?’ he whispered his
question. The man stepped out from his hiding place, his hand placed firmly
under the constable’s chin, the other at the top of his head. He smiled as he
looked at the constable huffing and puffing at the bottom of the stairs. 

‘Your mobile phone!’ the man directed the constable in his grasp
slowly down the stairs to where his colleague stood. 

‘You are a fucking dead
man’ The constable hissed as he pulled his mobile phone out of his pocket.
The man quickly searched both their pockets. He pulled out their ID cards,
mobile phones and wallets.

He karate chopped one on the neck and kicked the other right
between his legs, before he ran up the stairs and took the elevator down. 

He hit the button for basement in the elevator. As people got on
and got off the elevator, he studied their IDs and drivers’ license. He got off
the lift and stepped into the parking lot. Soon enough he found just the sort
of vehicle he was searching for. A bike with the helmet clasped to the rearview
mirror. He pulled out the knife from his socks, and placed the blade on the
ignition lock. With his hand wrapped around the handle like a nail head, he
thumped it till the lock gave way. He bent down under the handlebar, found the
wire connected to the battery and hotwired the bike. 

As he revved the bike, he turned his wrist to make note of the
time. 

1608 hrs.

He had twelve more hours to get the chain. Come thirteenth hour,
he would find himself strapped to a first class seat on a flight headed to
Lisbon. It was a good thing that the CRPF, the guys who were responsible for
airport security were independent of the local cops. He checked his front
pocket and felt the outline of his passport. And if anybody at customs inquired
about the lack of baggage on him, he would just repeat the woe of the unlucky.
‘Airline lost his baggage.’

But first, the inspector, his only lead, a solid lead, and
that’s all he needed.

  

*12*

‘Sir!’ The constable
gasped for air as he stood leaning against the reception desk. 

‘Who is this?’ the
inspector barked into the phone.

‘Murthy sir!’ The
constable answered. 

‘What happened to your
mobile?’

‘He…’ Murthy began to
explain.

‘What the fuck! Why you
calling me from your mobile now? Hold on’ The inspector spoke irritatedly
into the phone. 

‘Inspector? I have something you want’ The man spoke in a calm
manner. 

‘Where are you?’ The
inspector questioned, he clenched his fists with anger. He wanted to bang it
hard against the wooden desk. 

‘I am at Prasanna’s house. You know the place. And I hope that
when you come, you don’t come empty handed.’ The man hung up. The constable was
still holding the other line open. 

‘He fucking got away
didn’t he? You fucking whores! All I asked you to do was fucking keep an eye on
him. You useless pieces of shit!’ The inspector yelled loud enough for the receptionist
to step back a little. The two constables looked at each other sheepishly as
one massaged his neck. 

The inspector cussed loud enough for the entire station to hear
and be wary of him as he stepped out and motioned to his driver to get the Hoysala
jeep out. 

He got into the jeep and shouted at the driver to take him back
to the hospital where Rajshekar and his men were admitted, when his phone
buzzed again. He looked at the name flashing on the screen and cussed aloud
again. The inspector held out his hand, motioning at the driver to stop for a
moment. He continued to stare at the name on the screen and weighed the pros
and cons of answering the call. 

Somebody had snitched. Inspector banged his hand hard against
the dashboard before pasting a wide smile on his phone and swiped across the
screen to answer the phone. 

‘Vishwa Anna! How are you?
I was just thinking about you?’ The inspector gushed into the phone. The
driver took his cue and immediately got off the jeep. 

‘What inspector? You
thought that my men will get admitted in a hospital and I won’t get to know
about it? What is the motherfucking
point of giving you money and free pussy? Huh?’ Vishwa Anna barked into the phone, his voice crude and raspy
with years of smoking beedis. 

‘I didn’t want to disturb
you Anna! This is all small matter Anna!’ The inspector groveled. 

‘Who is this man?’
Vishwa Anna demanded as he held aloft the chain in his hand and inspected the
medallion on it, Prasanna sat squatted next to his feet. 

‘Some foreigner Anna!’
The Inspector began explaining. 

‘Then nobody will cry when
he goes missing. Everyday some foreigner or the other goes missing. I keep
reading it in the newspapers’ Vishwa Anna chuckled, Prasanna allowed
himself to smile. Vishwa Anna kicked him hard, his white leather sandals
planted right on Prasanna’s face. 

‘What the fuck are you
smiling at? You fucking whore’s son! All this is because of you! And you alone!
I will deal with you later’ Vishwa Anna screamed at Prasanna who pushed
himself away using his palms before clutching his cheeks. Prasanna wiped the
corner of his mouth which had begun bleeding, the inside of his cheek had cut
itself against his teeth. 

‘Where can I find this man
inspector? Give me a good reason to understand as to why I give you money’
Vishwa Anna demanded. Prasanna strained his eyes through his bushy eyebrows and
looked at Vishwa Anna. Vishwa Anna was dressed in a crisp white shirt and white
dhoti with matching leather sandals. His neck was covered with three thick
chains of gold. His fat fingers covered in gold rings, each studded with a
different stone. One look at Vishwa Anna and one realized that this is the man
you don’t want to engage in a physical fight with. His eyes were bloodshot, his
jowls heavy and hard. Vishwa Anna was what Prasanna imagined the devil looked
like. 

‘Wait there, I will be
there in twenty minutes’ Vishwa Anna ordered as he hung up on the
inspector. He turned his attention to Prasanna who still sat squatting on the
floor. 

‘You have a kid right?’
Vishwa Anna inquired benevolently. 

‘A boy anna!’ Prasanna
mumbled. 

‘Che!’ Vishwa Anna
shook his head with disappointment, ‘If
you had a daughter then I could have written off your debt. What should I do
with a boy?’ Vishwa Anna looked around at his coterie of loyal men. 

‘Anna, Ramaiah anna likes
them young.’ One of the cohorts spoke softly with a knowing smile.

‘Looks like you are lucky
after all!’ Vishwa Anna’s belly shook like a water trapped in a canister.

‘No anna! Please’
Prasanna launched himself off the floor and on Vishwa Anna’s feet. 

‘Ay!’ Vishwa Anna’s
eyebrows frowned, his lips tightened as he pelted Prasanna with hard slaps, the
rings on his hand made a clunking noise as they landed on Prasanna’s head. ‘Get off me!’ Vishwa Anna yelled. Couple
of the men standing around Vishwa Anna jumped and pulled Prasanna away. One of
the men slid his hands under Prasanna’s armpits, his fingers closing behind
Prasanna’s neck. The others took turns at punching Prasanna hard in the gut and
face. 

‘Spoiled the crease in my
dhoti’ Vishwa Anna commented as stood up to inspect his dhoti. 

‘Anna! Please! Not my son!
Please!!!’ Prasanna managed to cry aloud his pleas even as the blows rained
hard and fast on him. 

Vishwa Anna bent down and picked up the chain and inspected with
the medallion on it. Like a loose thread hanging off a dupatta drying in the
rainy breeze, Vishwa Anna flayed Prasanna’s face with the gold chain. Flesh
split open upon contact with the auric metal, blood splashed on Vishwa Anna’s
pristine white shirt and on the man holding Prasanna from behind. 

‘I don’t like it when men cry’ Vishwa Anna stopped to catch his
breath. He threw the chain at one his men who handed him a brand new white
shirt and a towel to dry himself off. Having wiped himself off Prasanna’s
blood, Vishwa Anna asked for the chain again. The medallion had split open like
ripe pistachio nut. One half of the medallion held a photo of a pretty young
woman and the other half held the picture of a young boy. 

Vishwa Anna smiled to himself as he clasped the chain with the
medallion around his own neck.

The bike put-puted at the signal. The LED board about the red
signal suggested another 190 seconds before it turned green. He maneuvered his
bike between a school bus and an auto in the traffic. He looked at the auto
driver and smiled. The auto driver, unaware of the man and his antics the day
before turned his head away. 

‘Uncle? Uncle?’ The man heard a soft innocent voice calling out
to him. He turned his head around and saw a bunch of kids sticking their heads
outside their school bus window. 

‘Which country?’ The kid questioned as the others giggled and
continued staring at the man with big toothy smiles. The man smiled back but the
smile didn’t reach his eyes, neither did he answer the kid’s question. 

His mind flashed images, he tried shaking his head clear of
them, but his memory had already started playing the movie. A movie he had put
the end title in the hotel room with a definitive bullet. 

Eleven men jumped over the side of the dingy boat with their
rucksacks and AK-47s slung over their shoulders. They quickly made their ashore
on Israeli coast of Lebanon. A woman yelled and shouted in an American accent,
calling out to her husband. Her screams were silenced along with that of her
husband with a quick burst of gunfire. The men quickly got rid of their wet
suits, and jogged up to the coastal highway. The men were members of Fatah, the
militant arm of PLO. Fatah group had gained international prominence when they
carried out the brutal Black September Massacre. 

They moment their feet touched the concrete highway, they opened
fire. The bullets caught the sides of passing traffic. One of the taxis
ferrying its passengers from Juniyah to the town of Jubayl skidded to a halt as
the driver reacted to the distinctive sound of gunfire. Three men ran towards
the taxi, spraying bullets like gardener sprays water from a hose. The pushed
and pulled the bodies out and commandeered the taxi.  

One of the armed men, having crossed the highway positioned
himself at a convenient location giving him unfettered view of the long stretch
of road. He was the only one who preferred the American M-40 with the mounted
scope. He lay flat on his belly, his eye firmly placed behind the telescopic
sight as he picked his target. His first was a teenager seated in the backseat
of a car, gesticulating wildly and worriedly at his parents in the front car. He
gently squeezed the trigger. Moments later, the teenager slumped in his seat.
The rear window resembled a mural made out of spaghetti and tomato sauce. 

Seven men got aboard a school bus, carrying 36 school children
and three teachers. The men shot the bus driver at point blank range before
throwing his body overboard. 

The eleven men had an open brief. 

‘Spread mayhem.’

The objective was to thwart the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks due
the following week. 

The man was in-charge of overseeing security for the talks. He
sat in his office going through the Hotel American Colony’s blueprint. Marking
the ins and out. He lit a cigarette and closed his eyes, imagining himself in
the shoes of a possible attacker. Yvet ran into his office, sadness and anger
streaming down his eyes. 

‘Aaliyah and Jonah!’
Yvet mouthed the names as the man watched him take support of the doorway
before slumping on the floor and breaking down.

The man switched on the TV set sitting in the corner of his
room. The news showed Israeli police cars chasing a school bus as the bus
bulldozed its way through the roadblocks. The man managed to read the name of
the school painted on the side of the bus despite the blurry images flashing on
the screen. 

‘Yehowah!’ The man
silently exclaimed as he grabbed the corner of the TV set and crouched on the
floor, willing the TV to change reality. The chain with the medallion swayed
around his neck, tinkling as it hit the TV screen, joining him in his prayers.

March 14, 1988. The 11 armed men took the lives of 51 Israelis –
including 27 children and wounded 83. In the final firefight, which ensued
between the seven men aboard the school bus and the Israeli police, the bus
burst into flames and exploded as one of the grenades slipped from the bloodied
hands of one of the men inside the bus. 

27 years later, the man who concocted the plan, the man who
financed the operation lay gunned down in a hotel room number 614, in
Bangalore. The death had brought closure to a three decade long pain. It was
meant to be the man’s last mission.

He was giving up everything after this mission. All his years in
training, everything he knew. The world it seemed to him, wasn’t done with him.
He heard the voice of Al Pacino in his head yell, ‘Right when I was out… They pull me back in!’ 

 ‘Nice bike’ the schoolboy
complimented the man. 

‘Fuck off kid!’ The man spat out as he revved the bike and shot
through the traffic as the LED counter counted down 3…2…1 and the lights changed from amber to green.

‘I need a favor saar’
The inspector beseeched the person he was speaking to over the phone. 

‘What is it this time Gowda?’ The speaker on the other end of
the satellite call spoke in anglicized English. His tone ruing the day he had
to get his no-good son out of a DUI. The two men, the inspector and he had been
classmates back in Mandya.

 ‘I need the number of that fellow you know’ Inspector continued with
his pleading tone.

‘Which fellow Gowda? I
don’t have time for this. I am in the middle of something here’ he replied
as he excused himself with a smile from the group of Japanese men dressed in a
sharp business he sat in the midst of. He buttoned his jacket and motioned to
the steward to get another round of expensive whisky for the Japanese
gentlemen. He tilted his head ever so slightly towards the young woman he was
seated beside him to engage the Japs. He watched her slide into his chair and
run her manicured fingers up one of the Japs’ thighs.  

‘This better be fucking
good Gowda, because if this deal tanks then I am going to fuck you till you
bleed tears out of your ass’ The man broke into chaste Kannada as he
admonished the inspector.

‘I need the number of the
CBI fellow. The one you gifted the escalate car to’ 

‘Escalade! Not escalate. And
what have you got yourself into?’ The man scowled before turning his back,
a big smile etched on his face and mimed ‘two minutes’ with his raised hand to
the bored Japanese men who were whispering to each other in loud hushed tones. 

‘Vishwa Anna’
Inspector explained. The name held enough gravitas for the man to acknowledge
that the call was warranted. 

‘Fine! I am texting his
number and I will tell him to help you out with whatever you need.’ The man
replied with resignation. ‘But this is
going to be last fucking favor I do for you Gowda. You and me are done. You
understand me?’ The man added.

‘Thanks maga’ The
inspector smiled as he hung up. He was still seated in the white Mahindra
Scorpio with the red and blue stripes down its side popularly referred to as Hoysala.
His phone buzzed. His lips spread in a sigh of relief, with hope. He tapped his
phone screen twice and held the phone next to his ear. He pushed open the car
door and stepped out. He heard the phone ringing on the other end of the line,
he prompted for the driver to give him a cigarette. The driver did his bidding.
The ringing stopped, and a weak male voice answered the phone.

‘Hello?’

‘Hello, Mr. Chakravarthy?’ Inspector Gowda inquired.

‘Chakraborthy… Buh… Not vuh…’ The bespectacled man pushed back
against his chair and closed the browser window with two women cavorting each
other on his desktop. 

‘Yes. This is Inspector Gowda, I hope our mutual friend…’ The
inspector began explaining before being abrupting cut short.

‘Yes. Tell me what do you want, and tell abour frand he and I
are done.’ The man spoke, his heavy Bengali mother tongue twisting and turning
his tongue to speak in a language he considered his inheritance. 

‘I have a passport. His name John Smith, I want you to take the
passport number down. And I want to know everything you can get’ Inspector
Gowda explained as he pulled out Mr. Smith’s passport from his breast shirt
pocket. 

‘I am listening’ the CBI man tapped few keys on his keyboard,
double clicked on the proprietary Central Bureau of Investigation’s software.
The software linked all the databases shared by Intelligence Bureau, the Indian
equivalent to United States Homeland Security, United Kingdom’s MI5 and the Research
& Analysis Wing, the Indian equivalent to United States CIA and United
Kingdom’s MI6. He waited as he heard cloth and paper rustling on the other end
of the line. 

Inspector Gowda held his mobile phone between his cheek and
shoulder as he tried keeping the page away from the thick cardboard cover. 

‘3.0.6.7.8.5.8.8.1’ Inspector Gowda narrated the passport
number. 

‘What’s the authority code’ the Bengali man inquired as his
fingers quickly pushed down on the number pad on his keyboard. 

‘Ah yes!’ Inspector Gowda exclaimed as he spotted the code on
the passport. ‘U for You. K for Kangaroo. P for paisa. A for Apple’. 

‘That’s the press corp’ Chakravarty explained as he waited for
the computer to spew out the results. 

‘What does that mean?’ the inspector wanted to know.

‘It means that the man you are looking for is a journalist. But
then again a lot of people are journalist. Them and their blogs and facebook
posts.’ The man half heartedly explained as he waited for the sand timer to
stop turning and change its shape back to a pointer. The screen turned blue,
with two words written in big block letters in black flashing across his screen
every second.

‘Access restricted: 753’ 

‘Aaga’ Mr.
Charkravarthy cussed under his breath. This wasn’t normal. He looked at the
code, ‘753’. He hadn’t come across this code in all his thirty one years of
experience. Something didn’t sit right. 

‘Hello?’ The inspector
inquired, wondering if his man in CBI was still on the other line or if the
connection had dropped out. He was after making what he presumed to be an STD
call. Inspector Gowda prided himself to be as old school as they came, much to
his teenage son and daughter’s embarrassment.

‘Yes, yes. How soon do you bhaant this?’ The CBI man inquired as
he continued staring at the computer screen. This was a puzzle he could put his
esoteric Bengali brain behind. 

‘The sooner the better sir, I am in how they say in English, in
a of fix’ Inspector Gowda smiled vacuously at his reflection in the Hoysala’s
tinted glasses. 

‘Okay, give me half an hour, I bill call you back’ Said the CBI
man before he hung up. He called out to his assistant and instructed him to
bring him the big instruction manual he hadn’t seen or read in over two years. 

‘Seven pi three’ Mr. Chakravarthy muttered under his breath. 

‘Nanna helu tinnu baa!
Half an hour!’ Inspector Gowda cussed
under his breath, inviting the arrogant Bengali man to come eat his shit.

‘Sir? Shall we go?’
The driver inquired.

‘Go? Go fucking where?’
The inspector scowled and spat the question at the poor unsuspecting driver in
frustration. 

As he flung the spent cigarette butt against the side of the car
and watched the embers split from the butt, a neural pathway in his old school
brain lit up. He quickly pulled his phone out of his pocket and scrolled down
the list of called numbers till he found Rajshekar’s number. He waited till his
phone was answered.

‘Where did Prasanna say he
dropped the girl last night?’ The inspector jumped his question, this was
no time for foreplay. 

‘Acropolees, the big
building next to Forum mall’ Rajshekar wheezed his response. 

*15*

Charkravarthy’s phone buzzed, like a fly caught
inside a car with its windows rolled up. His beady eyes glistened with the
black and white text flashing before his eyes as he frantically tapped the keys
on his keyboard. The manual which lay spread beside his terminal didn’t list
any error code numbered ‘753’. 

‘Sir?’
The wiry kid dressed in ill fitted hand stitched clothes stuck his head through
the door. 

‘Haram jada!’ Charkravarthy cussed as he opened his eyes as wide as they
could, trying to summon all the telekinetic powers needed to incinerate the man
standing in front of him.

‘Bhaat?’ he barked at
the kid who stood perplexed, with thick beads of sweat rolling down his back. 

‘Sir, your phone?’ The young man pointed towards the blinking
3.7 inch phone screen. The assistant just paused long enough for his boss to shift
his angry eyes from him and look at his phone.

‘Hello?’ Charkravarthy barked into the phone. 

‘Mr. Charkravarthy?’ The voice on the other end of the phone was
both electronic in its tone and muffled in its volume. 

‘Yes?’ Charkravarthy knew an authoritative tone in someone’s
voice even in his sleep. And this was definitely authoritative voice on the
phone speaking to him. 

‘Step away from your
computer!’ The muffled electronic voice on the other end of the phone line
instructed the now visibly nervous Bangla man. 

‘Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!’ 

Charkravarthy heard the command being barked, not from the phone
but from outside his office. Black uniformed guards put his poor assistant in a
stronghold as Charkravarthy stared at the opening of a gun barrel. 

Charkravarthy’s reflexes kicked in as he put his hands behind
his head and waited for further instructions. His sub-consciousness had
registered enough action movies his teenage sons watched for his body to
respond accordingly to the situation. He strained his eyes and looked beyond
his bushy eyebrows and saw a tall angular faced man pushing his phone back into
his pocket. 

‘At ease!’ The man
commanded the armed guards surrounding Charkravarthy.

‘Mr. Charkravarthy?’ The angular faced man questioned as he
seated himself on the other side of the table. 

‘Yes.’ Charkravarthy
replied, his bottom lip quivered as his mind tried to settle the bet between
flight and fight. 

‘My name is Shankar Vaidyanathan. And I am from Intelligence
Bureau’ The man with the clean shaven angular face introduced himself. He
didn’t extend his hand forward neither did he join them together in a Namaste. Charkravarthy’s
lower lip stopped quivering. 

‘You know what annoys me on early Sunday evening?’ Shankar posed
the rhetoric question. 

‘Getting called to take care of business. Though I must say that
I much prefer doing this than listening to my son practice playing the violin.’
Shankar smiled as he slipped his hands into his pant pockets. Charkravarthy’s
eyes followed Shankar’s hands and saw him pulling a cigarette case. 

‘You smoke?’ Shankar snapped open the cigarette case and offered
it to Charkravarthy who suspiciously pulled a singular cigarette out of the
neatly lined case. ‘Of course you do. I am sure that you have many questions
running through your head. Such as, who am I? What am I doing in your office?
Who are these armed men?’ Shankar paused long enough to light his cigarette.
Charkravarthy leaned forward with the cigarette cupped between his lips. 

‘Like I said I am Shankar Vaidyanathan from IB and these men
are, well they are armed and trigger happy’ Shankar chuckled as he coughed up
smoke caught in his lungs. ‘The rea…’ He coughed some more. 



‘The reason I am in your office right now is because you ran a
check on a passport number UKPA 306785881’

## Chapter 1

A
tight slap across the girl’s soft cheek stopped her from screaming for help. 

‘Where can I find him?’ Vishwa Anna questioned the
girl, his fingers grabbed the girl’s hair, pulling it from its roots.

Fear
seeped through the girl’s jeans, wetting the car seat. 

‘The man you were fucking last night! Where is he?’
Vishwa Anna expounded his question, as he shifted in his seat, his eyes
languidly straying over the girl’s contours. 

‘I don’t know! I don’t even know his name! Please let me go!’
The girl screamed. 

‘Take the car to the lake’ Vishwa Anna tapped the
driver on his shoulder from behind as he gave the direction. 

‘Eh! Give the newspaper’ Vishwa Anna yelled to the
guy seated behind him. Vishwa Anna handed the newspaper to the girl, ‘Here! Sit on this. Stop pissing in my car.’
Vishwa Anna waved his hand. Two pairs of hands reached out from behind pulling
the girl to the very back of the car where they proceeded to pull apart her
clothes and rape her. Her screams ignored as the lights on Vishwa Anna’s car
blared down the outer ring road, warning other vehicles to make way. 

#

The
man ignored the school bus and trained his eyes on the traffic signal when he
heard a familiar voice calling out to him in the din of the idling motor
engines.

He
smiled as he saw Shivu waving out to him with Dr. Sinha looking on. He waved
back. 

‘Do
you want pizzaaa? We are going to have pizza for dinner!’ Shivu yelled as Dr.
Sinha grabbed the little boy’s shoulder, admonishing him for sticking his head
out the window. 

 The man chuckled at the absurdity of it all.
Here he was running around trying to get back the last connection he had with
his family, and there was a young boy gleefully sharing his dinner plans with
him. The man caught the signal changing from the corner of his eyes.

‘I
will see you!’ The man yelled before he sped away. 

‘Shivu!
Get back inside!’ Dr. Sinha commanded as she shifted gears. 

#

     ‘So Mr. Chakravarthy…’
The IB officer stubbed his cigarette atop the table, ‘Where can I find
Inspector Hemant Gowda? 

Chakravarthy
immediately jerked to reach for the phone in his pocket. The sudden move had
made one of the trigger happy armed commando twitch. 

Zzfftt!

The
bullet lodged itself firmly between Chakravarthy’s eyebrows. Chakravarthy died
immediately, his hands stuck in his pocket. 

Shankar Vaidyanathan groaned aloud as he shook his head. He
leaned forward to pull the dead man’s hand out of his pocket and found his
cellphone. The IB officer continued to shake his head in dismay as he unlocked
the phone screen and scrolled through the call log. 

‘Wipe the scene and for fuck sake follow protocol’ Shankar
mumbled as he stared down at the commando who had pulled the prematurely pulled
the trigger. 

Shankar walked out of the room as he swiftly dialed the Inspector’s
number from the dead man’s phone. 
‘Hello? Inspector Gowda?’ Shankar smiled as he spoke into the phone.
