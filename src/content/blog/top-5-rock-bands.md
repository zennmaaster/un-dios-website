Olrite. This is my all time Top 5 rock Bands. Its me list. I know you guys will have a bone to pick after this. But fuck you. You are welcome to drop in your top 5 list.

1. Metallica (thank.) : It was by far the biggest band to have a single most influencing presence in me life. The best part is that all their songs are malleable in nature.

2. Pearl Jam (thanks to naru): Love the voice, which sings from the bottom. Has helped me cope shit in me life. Has seen through me through the shittest of time.

3. Audio Slave: All time fav. Everything is awesome about it.

4. Linkin Park: Nobody puts teenage angst in better rhyme and rhythm.

5. Tenacious D: Should watch them and listen to them to realise the genius called JACK BLACK.
