I am crying! I am drunk out of my senses right about now, I know nobody will be coming down to this section, which is I have had to track this thread down to write it all down... FUCK! I want to scream, wail and bawl my eyes out. I want to smash my fist into things and do some serious fucking damage, just so that my fist fucking breaks and I can mask this pain inside with some serious physical pain!!!
