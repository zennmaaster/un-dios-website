I don't like people who get obsessed with money. Think it blinds people from what really matters. And gives them an excuse for shitty behaviour. All in the name of I have to earn money to do shit. But all you end up doing is shit. Nothing worthwhile. Nothing that actually makes you happy. And if you aren't happy then by default neither are those around you. Especially the people who want to be around you. I know and understand people who seek routine in their lives. But how in the world does that make people content is something that I don't understand. I have tried. But I fail. Repeatedly. I believe that it is against peoples' very nature of being maximisers. Of wanting to do and be more. Being in equilibrium and being content is a sign that one has resigned themselves to become obsolescent. Is that the reason why people try to overcome this lull in their lives by seeking validation and photo-documenting their lives? As a response and proof that they do have a life outside of earning money. As I write this, I realise that I am speaking from a place of privilege. That the reason I can raise these questions is because I no longer have to worry about money. But looking back at the times when I didn't. Especially the times when I struggled to make rent. The times when I envied people. Envied people with money and resources. Even then. I don't recall the quest was for money as much it was about the quest for freedom and power to do the things I wanted to do without being distracted by the basic instincts of survival. Yes! Money affords you the power and freedom to do things. But it's a trade-off that you sign up for. And when people fail to recognise the trade-off. That. That is what I dislike. The failure to recognise the value of the alternative. The power of choice. Ending up with being stuck in a vicious cycle. That is what I dislike. The irony of it all is that everybody wants to be the one who breaks the cycle. Not realising that you can't break shit if you are part of the wheel.



Take a step back. Value your time. Value yourself. Be happy. Rest will follow.
