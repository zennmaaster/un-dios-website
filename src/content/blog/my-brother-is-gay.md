My brother is gay or so I thought. But turns out the slimy little chuth actually likes women. Who would have guessed. Though am pretty sure he has more conversations and steamy scenes with them in his head than in real life. I know for a fact that if I told this to my mum she would be mighty pleased. But not like that fucker treats her any well. But seriously, he had all the inklings of a man destined to walk and swing on the other side. I have mentioned before that I have nothing against gay/lesbains (lesbians...sigh!!! they are so hot!!!) anyway... I mean look at me, if I had anything against them then would I given my brother to their cause free of cost. 

But it turns out he does like girls. His age I suppose. Who gives a rat's ass anyway. Poor guy. He is going to fall into the LJBF (Let's just be friends Zone) so often that am sure that the gay movement will soon find their prodigal soldier coming back to their ranks. Oh btw... turns out... my brother happens to read my blog on and off and is now aware of the different dynamics present in the family from my perspective. And this is what he has got to say... (His english and language are horrible... and if I am saying that then you can quite imagine...)
