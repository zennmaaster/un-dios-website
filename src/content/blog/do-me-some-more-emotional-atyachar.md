O! mere Patna Presley's...this is what adores my desktop right about now, and for a long time to come now...



Never has a single teaser for a movie driven me to such extents! I know I am going to hate the movie, I know I am going to expect a lot from it, but what the hell, the teasers so far is like the first kiss you ever had, you are not thinking of dipping your pinky in her dinky...but the more you keep kissing and petting, the more you want to do the funk and the first time always is not as what you had expected, the second time it is almost euphoric... Dev D and its Emotional Atyachar is just like that...Will go and buy some rubber just to be all prepared...
