Something I always managed to do for all Jan 30th's =)


You always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away i'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

i know i've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that i've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as i can take
And you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so i keep bending till i break

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what i need in you

Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes i've made along the way
But i always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if i chose to walk away would you be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
