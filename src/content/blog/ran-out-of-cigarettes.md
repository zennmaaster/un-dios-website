Ran out of cigarettes, patience and resolve. Everytime I think I know the answer to why (why did I want to study? Why is it important for me?) you know the questions important for intrinsic motivation... everytime I think I know the answer, I don't. And this shows in the graph. Had a slightly better week than the previous week but still a shit week. This is the week of April 27th to May 3rd, 2020.
