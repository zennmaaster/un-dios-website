I had
just poured myself a cup of coffee. My first and only cup of coffee. Sitting in
front of my laptop, reading the story that I am currently working on. Trying to
figure out which is the best way forward. When the following hilarity
ensued.

Addie Conole - 09:54

this is the year 2000




Addie Conole - 09:55

Athul DeMarco - 09:56

Addie Conole - 09:56

Athul DeMarco - 09:57

Clearly you are flexible, ginger and have long legs. Which are
always admirable qualities I presume




Addie Conole - 09:57

Haha, you want some more??




Athul DeMarco - 09:58

I would love to. Had this actually been the year 2000.
Unfortunately I am engaged. With a woman. So you know, don't want to get into trouble with
the missus

Though just curious as to how you got my mail id




Addie Conole - 09:58

Athul DeMarco - 09:59

right now!!




Athul DeMarco - 09:59

Ohh-kay then... 




Addie Conole - 09:59

Mmm...is the game getting "harder"? =)




Athul DeMarco - 10:00

Think the phrase is actually "the game is on"




Addie Conole - 10:00

Athul DeMarco - 10:01

Sorry but it currently out on a lease for the duration of this
lifetime to somebody else. And I am extremely sure that trespassing is dealt
with severely.

Did you know that I have written a book




Addie Conole - 10:01

Athul DeMarco - 10:01

Addie Conole - 10:02

Athul DeMarco - 10:02

Sure... had this been an alternate reality, a parallel universe




Addie Conole - 10:02

Here i just invited you www.letsplayoncamz.com?freeInvite=g2srt8
try accepting that babe




Athul DeMarco - 10:03

Its like you are not reading anything I am writing. 




Addie Conole - 10:03

Its supposed to be the best app for this kind of thing, hurry up
and accept!!!




Athul DeMarco - 10:03

But thanks for sharing. I am now extremely confused if I should
finish having my coffee or call up the missus and describe what is happening




Addie Conole - 10:04

Its worth the annoying signup babe, wait until you see what we
can do once you're in




Athul DeMarco - 10:05

I am sure it is the best app. And you sure are convincing. And
this is turning to be really hilarious. But how about I go now, finish having
my coffee

Bye now.




Addie Conole - 10:05

Its free to join.. i promise.. but it will ask for a card i
think.. im gonna get naughty and i cant have kids watching..




Athul DeMarco - 10:06

Yes. Clearly. Because the kids of today know about free porn
sites. This is NOT 2000. Desibaba is no more. Oh! You are making nostalgic now.





Addie Conole - 10:06

ofcourse babe,




Athul DeMarco - 10:06

I am lost. For words. And I can't seem to find my lighter. 

I don't suppose you have a light on you. 




Addie Conole - 10:07

xoxo
