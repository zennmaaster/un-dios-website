I actually started writing this post in Comic Sans. But then I
decided to go with Courier New. I don’t have anything against Comic Sans but I
do like type writers and all the clickty clack sounds they make. Think they are
super and are a lot more fun than comics. I like comics too. But I read them
really fast and then I am bored again. And buying comics is really expensive.
Because you would have to buy train tickets and build a time machine. Mostly
because the only time I really liked and enjoyed reading comics was when I was
8 – 9 and was travelling with my folks for the annual summer vacations. Kids
nowadays refer to them as “vacays”, like they are vaccines or vaginas. I wonder
when Hollywood is going to make a movie on Tinkle. Reckon I will go watch that
movie as long as it doesn’t star Abhishek Bachchan and
Priyanka-I-want-my-nose-to-look-like-Michael-Jackson-Chopra and is called
Drona. Which I did watch and hated myself every passing minute. 

Talking about watching something and not being sure about the ‘why’.
I wonder why people go to gyms and then want to talk about it? “I joined a gym”
“Okay... Why?” “I gym for an hour everyday and I do blah for my blah and then I
do blah for my blah”. At this point of time, everybody including me usually
retort with “Stop it! I am already getting tired just hearing about it”. What
we really want to say is “Stop it! You are annoying. And I don’t want to hear
about what you do to your blah blahs for how long. It wouldn’t hurt so much if
you used lube. You are an idiot.” I am pretty sure I was thinking of something
else when the RJ and the caller were having this conversation couple of minutes
before. 

At this point of time, I am thinking and wondering if I am funny
funny OR if I am funny like how mommies think their ugly rat faced babies are
the cutest little shits ever to have been pooped out of their urethra. So, I
did what any reasonably sane man with some residual common sense would do. I
googled and answered some of those online quizzes. There was some sound advice
there, I must admit. Apparently I have what is considered to be a juvenile sense
of humour and I need to learn how to tone it down a bit from time to time. 

Anyway, I need to go to the bank now to do grown up things and try
not to think “if I farted now, who is the most likely person the others are
going to think farted”.
