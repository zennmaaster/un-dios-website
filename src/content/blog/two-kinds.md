Stop me if you have heard this one before. 

There are two kinds of people. The ones who want to be the best
there ever was. And then there are the others who want to be the best till
somebody else comes along. 

There are two kinds of people. The ones who don’t know from
where their next pay cheque is going to come from. And then there are the ones
who always fantasize about their dreams.

I was one kind. Before I decided that I wanted to be the other. I
was on the right side of the law. Did everything my parents wanted me to do. Finished
my college. Found a job. Quit the job to study some more, in a foreign land. Found
myself a fabricated cell with limited access to the world wide web during lunch
hours. Parents felt proud of what I had achieved. I wanted them to come and
visit. 

There are two kinds of dogs. One which learns everything you
want to teach. The other wants to learn new tricks. And then there are the
others who are too old to be taught anything. 

My parents did finally come. We walked along the trail left by
million FOBs before us. They, my parents felt proud. I had gone where their
dreams refused to drag them. That’s the first time the ugly question raised its’
puritan hand. 

Is this all there is? 

There are two kinds of people. The ones who want to reach the
top and stay there. And then there are the others who jump from the top, hoping
to fly. 

I got married. Because that’s what people did at my age. I had
to find somebody to go out with. Watch movies. Enjoy couple of drinks and
dinner on a weekend. I did. It felt nice to share your silences.

There are two kinds of silences. One which speak volumes. And
then there is other which chokes your innards and stretches a mere second till
infinity. 

We tried to avert the second kind of silence from enveloping our
lives. So we gave birth to children. The world said we were blessed. Darlings they loved to call the three of
them. We watched them grow. We recorded it all. One tweet, one facebook status,
one instagram at a time. We watched them fall down and pick themselves up. We watched
them cry and laugh. We cried and laughed with them. 

There are two kinds of universes. The one which Newton and
Einstein described. And then there is other which involves the people you label
as family. 

I grew old and they asked me to retire. The children had grown
up and grown up fast. They left to conquer new shores. The hollow nest filled
itself with mournful silence and happy memories. And I remembered my parents. I
wondered if I had turned into them. 

There are two kinds of memories. Ones which make you smile. And
the other which you take to your grave.
