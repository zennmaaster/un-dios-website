Well I finally did manage to watch Om Shanti Om. Now if you remember me doing a Nostradamus about how Om  Shanti OM being something of trend starter. And no this is not another review about how awesomely great this movie was, or how SRK is called King and for how many reasons, and I have3 already mentioned Deepika Padukone being the next rage long before she was one of many models on the ramps. ( Reference : Charan ) . Though it has been such a long time since somebody created such huge flow of blood in male groin, and cardiac arteries, I mean I think the last time somebody had such an effect was when Priety Zinta debuted you know. 

No, but this post is all about this one single dialogue, which I think is inspired from "Alchemist" - Paulo Coelho. This is something which every die hard romantic such as myself keeps saying to myself, and finds a reason to wake up in the morning and look at the phone for the time. For those of you who have seen the movie, there is this sad song, "Jag Soona Soona Lage" which for some odd reason tore my heart apart and I cried, yes the same way women do when they are watching a movie and they are over-whelmed by the emotional roller-coaster ride they find themselves in, and suddenly I realized I was not afraid to wear my emotions on my sleeve, earlier no matter with whom I was watching a movie with, no matter how intimate we have been, I never allowed myself to drop my guard. And this is true. I have whole load of references for that.

And this is exactly what am saying. This dialogue was a positive reinforcement for me for the things I have done and the single defiant act of me sticking out for myself.  I mean there have been bad situations, and I always thought that was the "THE END". Like back in school when I was in my 11th and 12th grade, or when I found that relationships was just a whole load of bollocks for a lot of people and it was just a passe and nothing serious and my very belief of a fairy tale was something I was questioning on an alarming regularity, and always I knew there had to be a happy ending, and I think life is arriving at end of part of one of my life here.
