And no this is not something which the rest of the world is up to because of the Oscars… But as you can see, finally the little black book, looks like a little black book… And am happy I witnessed history being made with Slumdog sweeping the awards like India in T-20 world cup… But I definitely don't understand people talking about A R Rahman as if he was their cousin or son or something… Especially these madras dudes… Whats the connection people? You know what? Forgetaboutit… Don't tell me… =) 
I love this new look… BTW did I tell you that I have fallen in love with the habit of taking hot showers… lets see how long this affair lasts… =)
