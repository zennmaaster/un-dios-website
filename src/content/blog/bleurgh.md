Working on a new writing project. But, as always I am unsure of what it is that I am working. So... putting this up on here. Not like anybody actually is going bother reading. Anyway, enough of the emoness.



Following is the gist of the story I intend on writing.






What if the greatest Indian tale ever told,
Mahabharata, was not narrated by time or by some hearsayer? What if Mahabharata
didn’t have any of the nonsense involving gods, myths and fantastical elements
used to hide the true horrific nature of its characters? What if it was just a
story about a really powerful family and its power hungry and manipulative
family members?

What if…




     What if Ganesha was an advanced speech to text
software? What if the oldest character in the story of Mahabharata, Pitamah Bhishma,
was beginning to recount the tale of Mahabharata to expose his past and his
ancestors to tell the real story,
under the guise of V. Vyas? And what if somebody was trying to kill him? 

Love, Greed, Power and Family is a story which
takes all these ‘What If’ questions
and brings to light how the characters of the great epic be viewed in today’s
society.
