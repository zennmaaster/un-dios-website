Directed
by first time director Ali Abbas Zafar and produced by Yash Raj Films, Mere
Brother Ki Dulhan is a take on the age old bollywood formula of love triangles.
We have been conditioned to foresee the end even before we step into the theater. And you are not surprised by the end of the movie. Love triangles to
the Indian audiences are much like comfort food.

But this comfort food was neither comforting nor
edible.









Ali
Zafar, makes his debut as the ‘brother’, the third corner in the triangle. And
brightly does this corner shine. Imran Khan, reprises his role as the boy next
door, Katrina is the Dulhan, completing the triangle. The movie is pegged as a
romantic comedy. The romance is missing and the comedy is spread far and thin. But
the movie does have its plus points, they are few in number, but they are
there. Starting with the revelation that Katrina can dance. She did prove it
when she was Sheila, but this movie makes you take note that she is not just a
pretty face gyrating, but an actress dancing. She brings vivacity to her role,
especially the bits where she plays being drunk. 




Imran
Khan seems to be getting quite cozy in the city bred chocolate boy mould, the
London returned Ali Zafar sounds more rustic and in character than Imran Khan.
True that the story doesn’t demand great histrionics from the actors, but you
just wish a connect with the lead characters wa established with the audience. The
music is the real hero of the movie. And there comes a time when you wished
that the music was not really incorporated in the movie and was part of a music
video album. The YRF stamp is there to see in the song productions, but can’t
extend this statement to the rest of the movie. 




The movie
for me fails primarily because of the excessive depreciation of ‘filminess’ in
the movie. The movie seemed like a hangover of Namaste London. The difference
being that the movie is set in India, Imran Khan plays the role essayed by
Katrina in the first half. Things begin to get tolerable with the entry of Ali
Zafar, but after his exit, the movie drags on for an excess 25 mins longer than
it should have. 




Bottom line – I would exchange my tickets of Mere Brother Ki Dulhan for
multiple viewings of Bodyguard.
