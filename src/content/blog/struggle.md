Like the kids say, "The struggle is real". Been having trouble setting my sleep schedule, tried syncing it with my regular school schedule. But since I don't have to go anywhere, I am not really feeling the nagging pressure of time whistling by or having to do things. Been sleeping or trapped in the youtube wormhole. Even on the days when I did make a plan on the things to do, I couldn't/didn't stick to it.



This week, instead of trying to do one hajaar million things, will try and see if I can get 2 things done. Usually I set 3 things. But lets see how things go.



Anyway, verdict for the week of April 13th - 19th. FAIL! Not productive at all. Not one bit.
