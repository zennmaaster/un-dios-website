I am all dolled up in Rum n Coke and I am tripping on this song… Doesn't do me any good, that is for sure. But fuck it! I have been brain fucked since 5 in the morning, don't think it's going to change anytime soon…

 It's been a while 
Since I could hold my head up high 
and it's been a while 
Since I first saw you 
It's been a while 
since i could stand on my own two feet again 
and it's been a while 
since i could call you 
But everything I can't remember as fucked up as it may seem 
the consequences that I've rendered 
I've stretched myself beyond my means 

It's been a while 
since i could say that i wasn't addicted and 
It's been a while 
Since I could say I love myself as well and 
It's been a while 
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like i always do 
It's been a while 
But all that shit seems to disappear when i'm with you 
But everything I can't remember as fucked up as it may seem 
the consequences that I've rendered 
I've gone and fucked things up again 

Why must i feel this way? 
just make this go away 
just one more peaceful day 

Its been awhile 
Since I could lok at myself straight 
and it's been awhile 
since i said i'm sorry 
It's been awhile 
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face 
It's been awhile 
But I can still remember just the way you taste 
But everything I can't remember as fucked up as it may seem 
I know it's me i cannot blame this on my father 
he did the best he could for me 

It's been a while 
Since I could hold my head up high 
and it's been a while since i said i'm sorry
