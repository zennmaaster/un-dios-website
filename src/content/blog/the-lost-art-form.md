Batting in cricket is instinctual. Good batsmen
are reflexively responsive to their instincts and great batsmen learn to
discipline these reflexes. Fielding is lot like batting. The sharper the
reflexes, greater is the resultant adrenaline rush among the men who challenge
you. Both of these skills have been executed, action replayed and written about
for them to be elevated to an individual art form in a team game. Good and
great batsmen and fielders keep getting replaced on the field. The skill is
mastered, disciplined and the art form continues to flourish.




Much like art post the renaissance era, there is
an art form which is languishing. Much like the art world, there are few occasional
names which cause an enthusiastic flutter of nostalgic name dropping. But it
soon passes off like a fad rather than a prolonged legacy. Bowling, six balls
an over.  









Batting is like playing chess, you play the
situation. Fielding is like playing Scotland Yard. 




Bowling is like playing a mutant game of Texas No
Hold’em poker, chess and medieval style jousting. One has to play with the man
opposite you and the situation. The loneliest position on the vast cricket
field is not that of Long – on/off or third man next to the ropes. It is inside
the bowler’s mind. 




A lot is written and explained about the pitch and
how it would behave. And these are said in relation with respect to the knights
wielding the wooden swords taking guard on the barren patch of field. Lot like
how group of friends discuss their mate’s new girlfriend in his absence and how
if she will fit in with the whole group. Predictions and verdicts are passed on
if the girl will make or break the group. 




The story of David Vs Goliath is an allegorical
tale of a bowler against a good/great batsman. For a bowler, the relationship
is with the ball. It is not dependant on how flat the pitch is. It is not
dependant on how green the pitch is. It is not dependant on what the scorecard
reads. It is what he feels when he holds the ball in his hand. Does it feel
light yet solid? Does it feel heavy and unwieldy? 




Battles are waged between armies but they are won
by warriors. There are games which expound the theory of playing like a team.
Games like football, hockey and basketball to name a few team sports. But no
game and no warrior explains the theory of warriors winning battles and wars
than a maniac running down, ill armed with a small rotund object as offence and
defense against a well protected knight wielding a sword. 




The odds are never in favor of the bowler. 




And I suppose this is what defines one’s need to
be a bowler. The belief that the underdog can win. The stubborn belief that the
odds don’t matter, the belief that you can outsmart the crowd favorite and earn
respect while doing so. 




As a bowler I have loved charging down the pitch
and letting the batsman know exactly what I think of him. As a bowler, I have
loved smiling at the batsman knowingly, knowing that I have outfoxed him,
knowing that he is not a match, knowing that despite the odds stacked against
me are not enough to make the contest unfair or uneven. I love bowlers who do
the same and follow it up with the goods. This is not something to be confused
with aggression. This is a sadistic pleasure derived in being a masochist.
Though, to be honest, I have hated the same behavior in a bowler when I have
been batting. 




A batsman is a reactionary agent. A bowler is the
proactive catalyst. There were some great bowlers who understood the mental
aspect of the game. Who elevated the skill of hurling a ball through air into
an art form. People like Akram, Murli, Warne, Donald, Dominic Cork, Pat Symcox,
Chris Harris to name just a few (especially the ones I grew up watching). These
people were not the most exceptional as all round players. But when the ball
was handed to them, it was a sheer joy of watching them fox the batsman with
guile and skill. Dale Steyn, Suniel Narine and Wayne Parnell are few bowlers
who exhibit the trait which makes watching them as delightful pleasure. 




I fear that the bowlers, the warriors, the
proactive catalyst will forget street style cricket of mano-a-mano duels and
start thinking like reactionary agents. That they will start worrying about the
pitch, the score and the weather conditions. That they will forget about their
relationship with the ball. I fear the art form will cease to be recognized as that,
an art form. 




I fear that I will no longer be interested in
watching cricket.
