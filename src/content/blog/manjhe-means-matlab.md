EXT./ESTAB. NEW DELHI METRO STATION - DAY

INT. METRO STATION – SAME

A young man, KABIR, early 30s, regular looking guy, but is most
definitely our hero. When you look at him, you feel like he is
the sort of a guy who will rock out to ‘Kora Kagaz’ but the rock
version of it. He is listening to the radio on his phone. He
looks like, either he has had a breakup or the doctor has told
him that he had only few days to live.

He walks up to the edge of the platform, and we see the metro
rushing in hard and fast. Metal against metal screeching and a
loud whistle blowing from the security guards’ mouth. Maybe,
this is the last time we see Kabir alive.
                                                            CUT TO:

INT. METRO – SAME

Kabir enters the metro and puts the bag on an empty seat.

Kabir enters the metro and puts the bag on an empty seat.

                         TRAIN ANNOUNCER (O.S)

               Kripya darwazoon se door khadey
               rahein

                    (BEAT)
Kabir leans against the door and looks out the window.
                          TRAIN ANNOUNCER (O.S)

               Agla station <Station name>

He takes his phone out, begins to type a message and then
deletes the message. His phone beeps, he looks at the whatsapp
message

                          MESSAGE

               Kabir, I love you! Please hum milke
               baat kartein hai.

Kabir goes through his gallery and scrolls through
all the photos before he lands on a single photo
which shows him and a gorgeous girl hugging and
smiling in a coffee shop.
                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP – FEW DAYS BACK

Kabir and the girl in the photos are sitting in a coffee shop.

                          THE GIRL

               I don’t think this is going to work

                   Draft - AC
               out Kabir

                          KABIR

                    (looks confused, like
                    a small child who just
                    realized that Santa
                    Claus is not real, nor
                    is chota bheem)
               But why?



INT. FLIGHT – DAY, PRESENT DAY

Kabir, is dressed in different set of clothes, he is looking
fresh and eager. The bag he is carrying is definitely different
from the one he had when he was in the metro. He stows his bag
overhead and buckles into his window seat. His phone pings, the
text message says, “Can’t wait!”, Kabir smiles the widest grin.
                         AIR HOSTESS

                    (to the passenger
                    seated in the aisle
                    seat)
               Sir, since this is an emergency seat,
               could you kindly keep your bags in
               the overhead storage compartment.

Airhostess looks at Kabir with a flirteous smile, you know that
the smile the airhostess smiles is not part of her job profile.


                         AIR HOSTESS

               Sir, since you are seated in the
               emergency seat, would you be willing
               to assist us during any emergency.

Kabir smiles and nods as the air hostess rattles off
instructions, the window seat passenger attempts to ask a
question but is interrupted by the flight announcement.

                         FLIGHT CAPTAIN


                    Draft - AC
               Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen.
               This is your flight Captain Gurpreet
               Singh… Along with me is first
               officer… Our flight to Mumbai will
               take 2 hours and 20 mins…

Kabir looks out the window as the Airhostesss looks at him as
she carries out of the flight instructions. The passenger seated
next to him mistakes the airhostess smile for Kabir to be for
him and smiles back lecherously.


                                                      (CREDITS ROLL)

INT. FLIGHT - DAY

Kabir is seated in the non-emergency seat, he is dressed in the
same set of clothes we saw him at the very beginning of the
story. Looking sad and devdas types. A different air hostess
brings out the food trolley.

                         AIR HOSTESS (#2)

               Sir, Veg or Non-Veg?
                         KABIR

               How much is it?

                         AIR HOSTESS

               Nothing sir.   Veg or Non-veg?

                         KABIR

               Non-veg.
               Thank you!

Kabir smiles. Air hostess smiles back politely as she hands him
a tray of food.

EXT. CHATRAPATI SHIVAJI AIRPORT – DAY, FRIDAY
MOHIT, (early 30s, dressed smartly in jeans and crisp white
shirt, gives a decent boy impression) and NIKHIL (early 30s,
dressed in 3/4ths and black metal t-shirt, gives a hippie vibe)
are eating a sandwich while waiting for Kabir’s flight to land.
Both of them check out the airhostesses who walk out of the
arrival terminal. Nikhil winks at few of them. Mohit is
embarrassed by it all.

                         MOHIT

                   Draft - AC
               Pooja ke baare mein kuch matt bolna!

                         NIKHIL

               Kyun?

                         MOHIT

                    (Rolls his eyes and
                    looks at his wrist
                    watch)
               Chal, uski flight land hogayi hogi

Mohit and Nikhil wait at the arrival gate and soon catch sight
of Kabir walking out with the same colored bag he had when we
started this story. Not the bag we see him stowing in the
overhead compartment. The friends greet and hug each other.

                         NIKHIL

               Abey Devdas jaisi halat kyun bana ke
               rakha hai?
         KABIR

Kyun, kya hogaya?

    (Rubs his hand over
    his chin to see if
    there is any growth)
         MOHIT

    (Glares at Nikhil)
Abey gadheda hai yeh!

         KABIR

Tu aaj office nahi ja raha kya?
         MOHIT

Abey pehli baar aaya hai toh maine
socha dost ko pick up kar loon.

         NIKHIL

Ghanta! Uski meeting hai Andheri

Wohi toh main sochoon. Acha tu apni

         NIKHIL
Haan tu nikal

    (He grabs Mohit’s
    sandwich and pushes
    him away)
         MOHIT

Cool hai. I ll see you in the
evening. Nikhil sun, Mondy’s par

                          KABIR

                    (Watches Mohit walk
                    away)
               Bacha bada stud type ki English bolne
               laga hai

                          NIKHIL

                    (Guffaws)
               Chal line pe lag ja.

                    (points to the queue
                    of people waiting to
                    get an auto)


INT. NIKHIL AND MOHIT’S 1BHK FLAT – DAY

Nikhil opens the main door and waves his hand grandiosely.

                          NIKHIL

               Welcome to the heart of the city!

               Shri Hari do sau do

                    (Turns back to look at
                    Kabir and points to
                    his right)
               To your right is Mohit and my room.

                    (Swivels on his heels
                    and points)
               To your left you will see that we
               have our hall with TV. And further to
               that is the kitchen with the fridge.

                    (To the space between
                    his room and the hall)
               This is the toilet and this is the
               bathroom.

                    (Walks to the kitchen,
                    opens the fridge and
                    grabs a beer)
               Peeyega?
                    (Kabir shakes his
                    head. Puts his bags
                    down and opens the
                    door to the toilet and
                    looks at Nikhil all
                    confused)
                         NIKHIL

                    (Laughs out loud as he
                    reads Kabir’s mind)
               Haan itna hi hai. When we moved in,
               it was an Indian style toilet. We got
               the landlord to get the commode.

                         KABIR
                     (Opens the toilet
                    door and struggles to
                    enter and close the
                    door behind him)


EXT. RAILWAY STATION – EVENING


                   Draft - AC
                         NIKHIL

                    (Slurs slightly)
               Wait here, I will get the tickets.

The two of them wait for their train at the station.

                         KABIR
               Yaar, I have heard so much about
               Bombay local trains and the bheed.
               But here there are hardly 10-15
               people standing waiting for the
               train.

                         NIKHIL

                    (Chuckles)
               Wait and watch

Kabir looks around searching for the train at the horizon.

Nikhil looks at his mobile phone for the time.
                         NIKHIL

               Listen, in another minute or so train
               will come. Once you get in, don’t go
               inside. Stand next to the door with
               your back against the seat. And
               whatever happens don’t move. But
               don’t worry, this train will be
               khali-khali. Kurla mein fight hoga.

Kabir watches the train enter the station and slowing down. He
soon realizes that the population of rajouri gardens has
descended on the platform have magically appeared and are trying
to get in. He follows Nikhil in a daze, swept by the sea of
people.

With every station stop, the train slowly and steadily Kabir is
finding it difficult to stand without stepping on anybody’s toes
or leaning against somebody. As the train departs the station,
Nikhil smiles at Kabir as one man tries to strangle Nikhil with
his elbow.

                         NIKHIL

                    (yells but sounds like
                    a whisper in all the
                    din)

                   Draft - AC
               Next station is where we get down!



EXT. KURLA STATION – EVENING RUSH HOUR

As the train slows down and pulls into the station, Kabir nudges
Nikhil and shows him a man holding the footbridge railing and
yelling obscenities and asking people to stop pushing him. They
both chuckle.

Nikhil gets down the moving train. Kabir waits for the train to
come to a complete stop. The other commuters spot a fast train
pulling into the other platform. The swarm of anxious and
harried commuters push Kabir both inside and outside. Kabir
pushes his way out and soon finds himself standing next to the
man yelling obscenities. Kabir looks on like a lost puppy. He
wants to join in with the man shouting obscenities and asking
the swarm of people to show some humanity but he finds that his
voice doesn’t reach his throat.

Finally a harassed Kabir sees Nikhil standing few feet away
laughing away like Gabbar asked him to before he killed him.
                         NIKHIL

                    (He yells in between
                    raucous laughter)
               OH! THAT WAS SO FUNNY!

                         KABIR

               Saale! Matbal tu hass raha hai aur
               yahan meri mummy sister ho rahi hai

Nikhil pulls him to the side and hugs him good naturedly while
continuing to laugh.

                         NIKHIL

               Chal! Ek aur train pakadni hai.

                         KABIR

                    (looks on with shock
                    and pain)
               Abey auto-wato se nahi ja sakte kya?

                         NIKHIL

                   Draft - AC
               Abey, chal na!

                    (Points excitedly at
                    the platform from the
                    overbridge)
               Jaldi chal, apni train aa gayi

                         KABIR

                    (Running frantically
                    behind Nikhil)
               Timbaktu ja rahein hain kya?

                         NIKHIL

               Town! Tu chal abhi! Anita wait kar
               rahi hai humare liye.

                         KABIR

               Anita kaun hai bey?
                          NIKHIL

               Abey friend hai.

                          KABIR

                      (sniggers)
               Friend? Ya gurrlfriend?

                          NIKHIL

               Abey friend-friend hai. Mohit ke
               saath kaam karti hai. And I think
               Mohit likes her. He says she is just
               a “good friend”. Pata nahi. He
               doesn’t tell me things as much as he
               shares things with you even though I
               am his brother.

Kabir playfully grabs Nikhil’s shoulders and squeezes it before
pushing him inside the relatively empty train with decent space
to stand.

EXT. FINAL? STATION – EVENING RUSH HOUR

They get off the foot bridge. ANITA, (early 30s, dressed in

                      Draft - AC
smart ethnic office wear) looks up from her phone and waves to
Nikhil.



INT. TAXI – EVENING

Nikhil sits along with the driver while Anita and Kabir sit at
the back, much to Kabir’s discomfort.

                          ANITA

               So this is your first time in Bombay?

                          KABIR

               Yeah! I thought you couldn’t call it
               Bombay anymore.

                          NIKHIL

               Abey people are idiots! Kuch bhi bol
               do samjhne wale ko samaj aana chahiye
                         ANITA

               People are not idiots! Bombay is what
               people used to call it and Mumbai is
               what it is today. Anyway, how are you
               liking it so far?

                         NIKHIL

                    (chuckles)
                         KABIR

               It’s different. It’s not like how
               they show it in movies. It’s more
               like a Deepa Mehta documentary.

                         ANITA

                    (laughs)
               Manjhe?

                         KABIR

                    (raises eyebrows)
               Manjhe Matbal?

                         NIKHIL

               Abey manjhe means Matbal. Jaise ki
               what means kya.

Anita stares at Kabir.

                         KABIR

               Why you staring at me?
                         ANITA

               I am still waiting for you to explain
               why Mumbai is like a Deepa Mehta
               documentary

                         KABIR

               I don’t know. I just landed today
               morning.

                         ANITA
               And you made up your mind so soon?
                         NIKHIL

                    lights up a cigarette)
               Abey yaar! You guys ask so many
               questions. Just chill na. He is
               recovering from a break up.

                    (scrunches his eyes
                    tightly realizing that

Nikhil mimes not to say anything to Anita but is wary of Kabir.
Kabir looks on inquiringly.

INT. RANDOM PUB – NIGHT

There is loud music, the place is filled with people getting a
drink after work. Most of the crowd is dressed in casuals and
work clothes. You can sense that Kabir feels slightly out of
place. Mohit and Nikhil are singing aloud to the song playing on
the speakers. Kabir is nursing his beer.

               firang crowd.

Mohit shakes his head vehemently. You are unsure if he shaking
his head side to side because he is drunk and doesn’t want to
move or because he think Leos is a bad idea)

Acha tell me this, and this is
something which has been bothering me

difference between Bombay and Mumbai
          NIKHIL

Bombay is state of mind. Mumbai is
what you felt in the local.

          KABIR

Matbal?


    Draft - AC
          NIKHIL

Bombay means independence, freedom to
chase your dreams in a way you see
fit. And Mumbai is the fight for
survival. Here you will find this
fellow (points to the vegetable
vendor on the road) selling
vegetables and side by side mein
playing the stock market.

          KABIR

What rubbish?

          ANITA

Everybody does ten things at once
here. Else they can’t survive. When
we used to live in town, there used
to be this tailor who used to run his
shop till evening and then he sold
ice cream. That’s how things are.
       (BEAT)
Why what did you think the difference
was?

           KABIR

I thought Bombay was more about
Amitabh bachchan wali filmein. You
know mills and strikes, underworld
dons, smuggling, dance bars and all.
And Mumbai is more like the Khans.
Mall-shawl, party-sharty.

           NIKHIL

Woh zamana kab ka gaya.

do nothing right.

Isn’t it true for almost all elder
siblings born in the 80s?

I think what my father really wanted
was either a futuristic robot or a
very obedient dog. You know somebody
who won’t question any of his
commands and still give him
unconditional love and respect
despite everything.

         ANITA

I just think that parents, especially
my father didn’t know and still
doesn’t know how to deal with me.
Like he was the elder son to his
parents. He had only brothers and I
am the only girl child in the whole
family. He raised me as a boy and
then when I turned into a teenager he
suddenly realized that I was a girl.
So suddenly I was told that I
shouldn’t do this and do that.

Why? You getting bored?

No. No. Waise, how is this Priyal? I
haven’t heard about her before.

            ANITA

She is nice I guess.

            KABIR

Matbal ki you don’t like her.

            ANITA

    (smiles cheekily)
No. Not really. Something doesn’t
seem right about her you know. She
seems very fake.

            KABIR

Nikhil always did have a thing for
women bit cuckoo in the head.

            ANITA

What sort of women do you go for?

            KABIR

Back in school, we were like the
three Khans. Mohit was like Aamir,
mostly because he was short and
always a kitabi keeda.

            ANITA

    (Laughs out aloud)
Oh yeah! The forever front bencher!

Nikhil was Salman and I was…

    (interrupting)
Shahrukh?
         KABIR

    (smiles and defends
    himself)
Nikhil always said that when he grew
up, he wanted to have a girlfriend in
every city. I was always like
Shahrukh in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Ek
baari pyar hota hai. Ek baari shaadi
bhi hogi.

         ANITA

    (Smiles)
So you telling me that your
relationship of 7 years was not love?

         KABIR

I don’t know. I thought I knew what
it was. But now I am not sure
anymore.

         ANITA


    Draft - AC
I thought you would know, since you
are such a big Shahrukh fan.

         KABIR

You know, when fauji and circus used
to come on Doordarshan, my mother
used to tell me, ‘Yeh star banega’.
And ever since then, I think I have
got something for Shahrukh. Not
because he was or is a good looking
actor or is a fellow Delhi boy. But I
think it was more to do with the fact
that my mother believed he could be
something which he wasn’t back then.
I think I have always chased that
dream.

         ANITA

And what dream is that?
                         KABIR

               You know be somebody who people look
               at and say, ‘ki yeh kuch karega’. You
               know like that ‘papa kehte hain
               song’. I think before Bon Jovi’s its
               my life was an anthem. Papa kehte
               hain was the anthem for people like
               us.

                    (BEAT)
               Somewhere along the line, I think the
               keeda entered my mind that maybe I
               will end up having a personal life
               like the ones I see in movies.

                         ANITA

               You know people say that finding the
               one person you love enough to spend
               the rest of your life is difficult,
               but I think finding the one person
               who will believe in you and your
               capabilities is lot more difficult.

               So what is the fascination with Juhu?
               Is it also like India Gate and ice
               cream?

                            ANIT

               I don’t know about India gate and ice
               cream.

                            KABIR
               Well, there is a tradition – if you
               come to Delhi, you have to visit the
               India Gate and you have to have ice
               cream there. Even if it is the middle
               of winter. It is just something you
               do.

               Delhi.

                            KABIR

               You been to Delhi?

               I had gone there once couple of years
               back on work. The only places I saw
               was my hotel room and the client’s
               office. Had to catch the flight back
               to Mumbai early next day.

Kabir smiles, a thought rises in his mind.

                            KABIR

               Okay, so here is the deal.

               and pav and whatever all day long.
               But if you lose then the next you
               come to Delhi, you come with me to
               see the real Delhi.

               And if I don’t like Delhi?

               First you come to Delhi then we will
               see.

EXT. JUHU CHOWPATTY – EVENING

The beach is buzzing with activity. Kabir looks around and takes
everything in. Suddenly he is overcome with feeling of being
alone in a crowd. As the two of the them walk towards the water,
Kabir notices young families holding an impromptu picnics –
Fathers buying their sons and daughters ballons. Few of them
taking rides on the horse. Kabir takes off his shoes and walked

                   Draft - AC
barefoot. Anita already has her sandals in her hands.

                         KABIR

               I can see why people like this place,
               but I am more of a hill station
               person.

                         ANITA

               When we used to stay in Dadar, my
               father would bring me and my brother
               every Sunday evening here. We would
               go till the edge of the water, dip
               our feet in and then walk back. Think
               that was the only time when I think
               my father was at peace.
         KABIR

There was a time when I think I was
in 5th or 6th standard. My family
decided to go do one of those south
India tours. You know visit all the
temples, see Kanyakumari and all. We
went to Marina beach. That was the
first time my feet touched sand. It
was weird. It was soft and ticklish.
And I saw those waves. Suddenly I was
overcome with this feeling. I don’t
know what it was. But there was this
feeling that everything will be
alright.

         ANITA
I know what you mean. You feel alone
but at the same time you feel one
with everything else around you. Like
you are part of something bigger than
just you and your world.

         KABIR

Yeah! But you know there is a thin

    Draft - AC
line between feeling alone but part
of a crowd and feeling alone in a
crowd.

         ANITA

I hate that feeling

         KABIR

I don’t know if anybody likes feeling
that way.

         ANITA

But that’s the thing with Bombay. It
makes you not think about those
things you know. There is always
something happening. It makes you
self reliant. You stop depending on
people. It makes you very self
sustainable. If you are dependent on
other people then you are done for
you know. Everybody is here for
themselves.
                         KABIR

               I need to learn that shit. I guess
               that is also one of the reasons I
               came down to Bombay you know.

               But I don’t think I can handle this.
