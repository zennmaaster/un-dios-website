I know I gotta find out a way to find out who leaves behind these anon comments, not that I am complaining about it. I know one anon is now happily (?) married, and she thinks its her rightful duty to remind what a bastard I am and I truly am grateful for that.

There are the other anon's a few I know from the battle on Orkut. Yes Maria that would be you and Andie me haven forgotten you.

But who the hell is 007 and anon. I know they are one and the same person. Am feeling like getafix in asterix and oblix, and I have a song
