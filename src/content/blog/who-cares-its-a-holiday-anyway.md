[You can hear me tell you that story OR you can read the approximate transcription of the story]

Listen! 



THE TRANSCRIPT

  

Me: So you all dressed for Easter?She: Maundy Thursday. Easter is on SundayMe: What does Maundy mean? Good Friday then?She: It’s a day of mourning… so not really dressed per say... Will explain laterMe: Isn’t it the day when Jesus died? If yes, then why is it called good Friday? Damn Romans! Just because they invented the calendar…She: Good Friday cos jesus died for mankind’s sins... Maundy Thursday = Holy Thursday... Last supper etc with his disciples was todayMe: I thought Maundy was like a slang for idiot… you know because I confuse the days of the week… And I seriously think that Good Friday is a joke which the Romans pulled on the rest of the juntaShe: we get bread and buns in church… Tomorrow we fast for the whole day and pray and will eat tomorrow nightMe: Why? I am sure the Romans gave food to Jesus… the Geneva convention makes sure of things like thisShe: No! Today was the day when he had his last meal… and THAT is why it is called the last supper you idiot… I love it when people call me an idiot… I don’t know why but it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy… anyway…She: When he was hung they gave him vinegar to drink?Me: Why what happened to water? High maintenance or what?She: They were torturing him you idiot… Me: That’s cos he was calling him a king…She: Yeah! And ceasar was king back then… so to torture him they gave him vinegar…Me: Caesar wasn’t king back then… He had that thing with CleopatraShe: Then it must be king herod…Me: Sounds like a bird… or is it a fish… She: No! I think it was Caesar… don’t confuse me now… plus I am church so fuck off now… will talk to you later…
