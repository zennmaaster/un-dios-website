Ok, its time for some ego massage now, not that i have much of an ego considering the way i get pushed around by all sorts of people and their schools of thought. And presenting to you the only photo in which i look everything else other than me... and that being somebody sober, pensive and most importantly goodlooking. 






Ok, you have to agree i donot look like the usual stoned self which i look like normally, not that i am stoned all the time, its just that i look stoned all the time, get the difference? Nevermind if you did not get the difference. This picture was taken when i was trying look like something cant recollect the exact expression i was trying to master, but hey who cares the picture came out real good, though the person who took the picture would like to mentioned here, i am not gonna do that. Why? if you haven realised am trying to massage my non-existential ego (wink...wink)



But this how i usually look like when am not smiling.... 



Stoned out of my senses, i wonder why? i mean am not stoned but i look stoned, haven seen many people look stoned even when they are, i take real pride in acquiring this look, not that i intended to adorn this look all the time, but the best things in life come unasked for and i think this is one of them, makes look stoned and cool since i look stoned.

And for those of you wondering how i look when am smiling? well the answer is pretty obvious, lets see if you can crack it, here is a clue i look stoned when am not smiling. NO, the answer is not sober even though it looks like it is the right answer. Well this is how i look when am smiling.

Well the answer is I LOOK DRUNK... thought it was the most logical thing to say, guess not, but yes i look really drunk. Its amazing how i don actually have to smoke marijuana or drink my usual rum and coke to get the desired effects. I mean how many people can actually lay a claim to the fact that they look shit faced when they are smiling or stoned when they are not... Not many i say.  Not that am looking to change the way i look, which i doubt anybody can help me with it. But i sure would like to know how i would look when am not lookin piss drunk or stoned. And also word of caution for people who are looking to sketch my face, i have screwed up eyebrows and they make your sketch look like or so i have been told. And i firmly believe that its too. I have a innate tendency to screw up other peoples work, i mean how many people can stake claim to the fact that they influence others work jus by the way they look. I take immense pleasure in the fact that i have that power, more importantly my eyebrows do... =)  More power to the untweezed eyebrows i say. =)
