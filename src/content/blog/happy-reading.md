Hello!



Been quite a while since I stared down at the blinking cursor. So here... Uploading ALL of the stories I started and left unfinished over the years (reckon some of this is from circa 2009). Not sure how long the download links will work for... So if you want to read something, reckon best to download them and then like most things in ones' refrigerator, junk them when mold begins to grow on it.



NOTE: The work is not proof-read, so there will be errors, spelling mistakes, missing words among others.






The Great Indian Mythology: Was supposed to be a re-telling of Mahabharat set in today's day and age in a tongue in cheek manner. But the more I read the actual original story, I realized I can't top the fuckedupness that already exists. But, I did enjoy writing few bits of it. 

Will rate this 2/5. If you think what I have written is fucked up, wait till you read the actual story... Not the PG rated Amar Chitra Katha... Also points deducted because I didn't finish writing the whole thing.

Delhi - Bombay: One of the first attempts at screenwriting. It is a rom-com. Or was supposed to be. Its' about this guy Delhi Boy Kabir and a Bombay girl Anita. They fall in love, and decide to get married. But who is going to move to which city? 

Will rate this 2.5/5. It has its moments.

Bond Series: At one point of time, I wanted to write a raw Bond type story. You know espionage, femme fatale but no Q or fancy gadgets and all. Just a man running against time to save the country and the world in style while getting laid and drunk, all expenses paid. There are two stories in here. One is titled error code 39 - Was supposed to be a story where China is laying high speed internet lines near Bombay to try and disrupt the stock exchange and beat the market and make India's market collapse. The other story is called, Tomorrow always comes twice - obvious reference and play on the usual Ian Fleming style titles. This I actually forgot what the story was supposed to be, wrote just the first chapter/prologue type for it.

Can't rate because never finished.

1949: I wanted to write a revisionist story about Ayodhya-Ram Mandir-Ram Lalla and the fateful night of Dec 22-23, 1949. Then I realized that I don't have the literary gravitas to pull something like this off. 

Same... No rating

The Man With No Name: This I had serialized on the blog only. Was supposed to be one of those John Wick type movies before John Wick was made. But had oodles of fun writing this. 

Will rate this 3.5/5

Molested Poppy: Another one of those detective-buddy type stories. It has few interesting twists that I liked while writing.

Will rate this 3/5

AL.AN - The Nemesis: Was supposed to be part 2 in the conjoined twins series provided that part 1 did well. Obviously, The Origins didn't do well, so Nemesis never did see the light of day. But now it does... 

Will rate this 3/5. Did some neat things with the font shont and all...

Satta/The Gamble: I actually quite liked the villain in this story if I recall correctly. It has a boy who sets his father on fire and then goes and attends a track & field event. 

NA


Also, whole bunch of other things/stuff...  some of them would score like 4/5 like XXY but I can't be arsed to upload the files separately now. Too bored. Also guilt has set in about me having wasted 40 odd days pretending to be a tuber vegetable. So time for me to go back to my books.
