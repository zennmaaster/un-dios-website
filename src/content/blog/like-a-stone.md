on a cobweb afternoonin a room full of emptinessby a freeway i confessi was lost in the pages of a book full of death reading how we'll die aloneand if we're good we'll lay to restanywhere we want to go  in your house i long to beroom by room patientlyi'll wait for you there like a stone i'll wait for you therealone  on my deathbed i will prayto the gods and the angels like a pagan to anyonewho will take me to heaven to a place i call i was there so long ago the sky was bruised the wine was bled and there you led me on  in your house i long to be room by room patiently i'll wait for you there like a stone i'll wait for you there alone  and on i read until the day was gone and i sat in regret of all the things i've done for all that i've blessed and all that i've wronged in dreams until my death i will wander on  These words seem to reverbrate through me whenever i find myself staring at the pitch black darkness which keeps screaming out my name to take the plunge into the unknown called the afterlife. For every man/woman, there is an anchor which ties him to life and the other urge governed by the prinicple of least action.   And somehow this song fills me up with emotions, for things i yearn for. Right now am like a ship with no mast and anchor, maybe am just ship looking out for the shores forever but before i find the shores i hit some reefs and sink down, maybe there aint no shore for this ship of mine, people who have been marooned know the feeling of loneliness, the urge to talk about stuff. Well not many people would have been marooned not since people put themselves in Tom Hanks shoes in castaway.  Every human is an island, self sufficient in his own right, but somehow he doesn't wanna be an island he wants to be a part of a bigger landmass, one where he has more options and not everything is to be done all alone. Today in this society's very fabric, very few people are fortunate to be part of this fabric, the rest are islands in their own respect, some of their own choice like mine and others cause of their insecurities.  This makes one ( me ) raise the question as to why certain people against their own will become these islands, why is that some people manage it really hard to find anchor for their ship or find a fellow crew mate as to where they want the ship to be steered to, and just revel in their company and vice versa there gotta be something inherently wrong somewhere in the big picture, is usually what mine or anybody else's guess might be, the other one which looks more enticing to stick to being these people maybe just too finicky and deserve a better mantle to be put on than what is readily available.  I think it is true that exceptional people must be treated exceptionaly, the normal rules of the society shouldn't be imposed on them and the same goes for the choices they are gonna make, it may seem weird, it may seem stupid but then again, exceptional is not something which the normal human tends to understand and comprehend so why take such hostilty and aleinate them from the social fabric.  And i realise am talking my head off... =p anyway think i will come back again to do some more verbal crap... =p
