So, after nearly close to 2 years, I am going back home. The reasons are just too hard for me to ignore anymore. My godmother is recuperating from an operation, and probably will get back to her old self if I am there talking to her and making her laugh and letting her know that her godson is not doing so bad after all. My mum has been aching to get a sight of me for donkey years now, but for whatever reason never was quite comfortable with meeting up my parents. 

 And god knows the status quo would have been maintained for many more years had it not been for a certain somebody. In the meantime, will also help out mum in her new venture as an entrepreneur, will certainly help change my status from being a jobless bum. 

 Anyway, will go now. Later…
