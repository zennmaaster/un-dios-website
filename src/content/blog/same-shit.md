You know off-late something has been bothering me cos I have heard the same shit time and again and people think its a given esp when it comes to me. 

I mean no matter what shit happens people think that I can deal with it and that I am strong enough, I mean sure they say it as a good thing, but what they don fucking understand is the fact that I am just like you fuckers, I suck at dealing with emotions so I don't know if am supposed to laugh or cry or jus fucking keep quiet and not talk about it. 

I really have no fucking idea what makes people think that I am strong. Because of this shit only I have been hurt time and again and all those pansy assed camel dick suckers get away with it by saying "oh you can handle it, you are strong, he/she/I is/am not". If Penn & Teller were there in my place then they would scream out loud "BULL-FUCKING-SHIT". well they don say fucking but they fucking should. 

And yesterday when I went with my colleagues for a drink 2 of the many things were reinforced.

A man should know how to hold his drink and tongue. I mean go ahead puke your guts for all i care but fucking keep a lid of your mouth. The other being I cant fucking deal with emotions irrespective if its mine or others. Sometimes it scares me but in more cases than not am actually quite happy, am not left to be some slobbering shit faced chuth who bawls his eyes out cos somebody said some shit. People say shit... deal with it. And Drinking is a good way. The keyword here being "DRINKING" not fucking talking. 

Fucking losers. 

BTW I spotted a new trend... people shifting places, places as in areas of residence, am still mulling over the various possible causes. Earlier it was people breaking up, then it was cheating, then it was baby boom time, now its people shifting places... and people are still not clear as to what hair style to cut their hair in this season... 

ps: I have no fucking idea why this blog is titled same shit... So sue me! 

pps: and if you are good then I may even let you blow me...off... like fuck off! not blow off like a porn star!

ppps: I am rambling now aren I?

pppps: this is what happens when there is no fucking work to do for an entire week!
