Well, ladies and gentlemen! The barnacle is back. I had taken a sort of a hiatus, tried getting my soul back from the devil, little did I realize that I am the Devil. So ladies, hit the gym, get in shape, use moisturizers, use anti-marks cream for your ass (yes! That is a turn off!). Remember to smell good, because it is that time of the year again, when you take out those cloths which you discarded when you passed out of kindergarten. It is going to be awesome. Calling out to all bro's, it's time to SUIT UP!
Quote to the Bro's : "Without you, I am just Dynamic Uno."
Quote to the skeptics: "Trust me, it's going to be LEGENDARY!!!"
Barnacle advice to fledgling noobies: "Best way to break up with a chick…'You. Look. Fat. In. Those. Jeans.' And you are free to go"
Quote to friends who are sitting at home watching TV while am out awesomming: "This is AWESOME!"
Peace out Hombres.
