I tried writing about the life in jorhat, delhi, henoch schonlein syndrome, well its just that my life is so fucking layered and peppered with so many incidents, which make me cringe thinking back about my stupidity, and things which are so bloody brilliant, if i may say so myself ( talk abt being modest ). So me will talk about my first crush, my first brush with death, my first best friend, the passion of relishing and eating fruits. But its just too disturbing and layered for me to write it all down. So me will now stop that continue random crapping about life in general and shit. Stay tuned cos the next post is gonna be about... ( honestly I have no fucking Idea)
