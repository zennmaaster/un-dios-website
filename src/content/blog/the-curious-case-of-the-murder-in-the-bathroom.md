Now, this one is a proper, proper short, really short story. Now for you fancy shmancy pants, there is the mobi version for your kindle HERE and for the smart phone people, the epub version is HERE. For people who still prefer reading stuff on paper but are slowly moving towards reading things on their laptops/desktops(? Do people still use that? At home.), you can download the pdf file HERE. Initially I had planned on copy pasting the story in the blog below this opening lines thingy, but the text boxes weren't showing up on the blog so had to ditch it. 

 Like the name of the story suggests, a murder takes place, in a bathroom.
