Allo!



Did absolutely fuckal all of this week. Only started to study think from Saturday onwards. Has been slow. Been wasting a LOT of time still. Need to get on the No Fap challenge thingy. Reckon everytime the urge arises (pardon the intended pun), will probably lift dumbbells. And it is yet to be seen if YouTube Music subscription is worth the money and if it will stop me from jumping down the rabbit hole.



Anyway, here is the absolute fuckal picture of wasted time. Reckon should get on a all boys' call from time to time, just to remind myself as to why I am doing this again.
