One of my Friends decides to interview me here are few excerpts ( Fine, she sent one of those forwarded mail, but the lie is definitely cooler than the truth ain't it )

1. Whom are you named after?

A: Dammit! Din't we go through this already.

2. When was the last time you cried?

A: Even though Spartans Don't cry, I did cry I guess, if you can say the act of tears welling up in your eyes as crying. Olrite Olrite, I cried when LJ talks to his Father Lincoln Burrows the last time in Prison Break. Hey I got some father issues. Deal with it. 
 
3. Do you like your Handwriting?

4. What is your favorite Lunch?

A: I would Ideally love to eat Subway Sandwich, my Favorite being Italian BMT. Though there is raging argument over what the BMT stands for. A lot people are mistaken and think it stands for Bigger, Meatier and Tastier but it actually stands for Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit. This was where the the first Subway stall was opened and this was the first and the only sandwich available back then. Yes, eating Subway sandwiches makes me intelligent.

A: None till the last time I checked. Though I maybe having some alien ones, you never know, you kno, aliens might have abducted my fine piece of well formed behind, and then the female aliens would have revolted against the MCP aliens and fallen in love with me and in exchange of my freedom they would have asked for one night in paradise, and being true gentleman I am, I would have gone ahead and would have given in, but of course I won't remember the other-worldly sex, because after that they erased all memory of it. *shrugging shoulders*

6. If you were another person would you be friends with you? 
A: If I was another person ( that rules me being a Snowman, snowman is an "it" everybody knows that) then there are 2 scenarios, one where am a luscious hot woman, then hell yea I would be more than friends with me, and if am guy then maybe I will just learn how to live life from me then.

A: Nope. But if thats wat gets you off I should be happy to use it. ( psst is that some male contraceptive? )
