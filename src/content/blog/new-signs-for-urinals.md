Yes, my fascination with loo's and shit still continues. =)

I was just wondering the futility of bathroom signs. This is the normal conventional signs you see in any restroom.          And what stuck me was the fact, how irrelevant and obsolete these signs are anyway. I mean there are an increasing # of women who prefer wearing pants, and men who wanna cross dress ( and no I do not feature in that ). I mean seriously, the other sign featuring men with facial hair and short hair. But then again, if women esp in engg. colleges are any indication to go by, and with men trying to be metro-sexual ( read gay)  then even those signs are gone for a toss. I mean the  presence of dress/ hair does no longer signify women or the absence signify men.

So how should the new urinal signs look like? What criterion should they be designed on? Definitely not on the cultural stereotypes. Well if you ask a pervert like me, I will most definitely say it should be designed on "Equipment".

But then again, the challenge for the designer is not in drawing the "equipment" but in getting past the censor boards, because they most definitely will be a rage among perverts like me, and the best hangout spot will be outside the Loo, where ( i donno about others ) I will be standing and pointing at it and laughing my not so well formed ass off. And because of that the restrooms in India esp will get a makeover since they are known for their spine tingling, coma causing aromatic power.

Hell, I think with my radical ideas I may as well run for President.

ps: I like to talk about shit, not be in it. I ll pass the presidency for some lesser mortal like say APJ. ;)
