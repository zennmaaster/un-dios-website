Apparently I can get quite narcissistic after I have had one to many to drink. Shouldn't come as a surprise to those who are acquainted to me and me ways. But what should be surprising is the absolute non - sense I tend to talk about when inebriated (when compared to being sober). To make matters worse, my confidante enables this behavior, not that I am complaining...

Anyway, here is me going Guantanamo Bay on my girl quizzing about what every guy wants answers for... The size of his dick/wiener/dong/penis/manhood/spunk ejaculator in comparison to a pornstar.*











PS: IN MY DEFENSE... I WAS DRUNK!



PPS: AND I WANT MY LAWYER!



*PPPS: Obviously since the results are in my favor is the prime AND the only reason this finds a place here. Otherwise it would have been trashed like an used tampon.
