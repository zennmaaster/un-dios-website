Once
upon a time, not too long ago, there was a young girl named Lucy. Now Lucy had
really long black hair, which she used to oil every Sunday and then take bath
in hot water. She used to love her long black hair. She used to put clips and
beads in her hair. She used to sway her head, left and right, left and right,
left and right and loved the way her hair moved left and right, left and right.


One
day, she was walking back from school as she recited the alphabets out aloud,
in a sing song manner. Dressed in sky blue skirt, her hair tied in a ponytail,
black shoes with shiny silver buckles. 

‘A
for Apple. B for Bat. C for Cat. D for… D for… Dog… A for apple. B for Bat. C
for cat. D for Dog…’

As
she skipped and jumped and walked, her hair swishing and swaying along with her
happy little steps, she saw something sparkle on the side of the road, where
the grass grew as high as her knees. She stopped skipping and jumping. It
shined again, bright as the sun in the afternoon when she played hopscotch
during lunch break. Excitedly she went closer to see what was shining behind
the grass which grew as tall as her knees. And there it was, the shiniest,
brightest, and the most colorful hairclip she had ever laid her eyes on. As she
stuck her hand out and picked up the shiny, bright and colorful hairclip, she
heard a small girl’s voice. 

‘Heyllo!
My name is Alice. You have pretty hair’

‘Thank
you. I oil it every Sunday and then take bath in hot water. My name is Lucy’
she replied smiling as she saw the hairclip talk to her. The hairclip looked
like it was smiling back at her. 

‘Will
you put me in your hair? I will be your best friend. I will hold your hair up
and you can style it anyway you want. Please?’ Alice, the brightest, shiniest
and the most colorful hairclip Lucy had ever seen asked her. She even said
please, and Lucy remembered her mother telling her that when somebody requests
you something and say Please then you should try and help them. 

‘Yes!
That will be lovely. You and me shall be the bestest of all friends and I shall
wear you in my hair every day. I ask my mommy to put you in my hair. Till then,
I will hold you in my hands’ And so, Lucy smiled even a bigger smile and
continued skipping and jumping and reciting the alphabets along with her new
best friend Alice. 

‘A
for Apple. B for Bat. C for Cat… D for… D for… Dog… D for Dog.’

As
the two new best friends skipped, jumped, walked and sang their way home, Lucy
noticed that a puppy had begun to follow her. The puppy was copying everything
Lucy was doing. The puppy jumped when Lucy jumped. The puppy skipped when Lucy
skipped. The puppy barked when Lucy sang her alphabets. Lucy sat down on the
grass and the dog sat down too. Lucy rolled in the grass, the dog rolled in the
grass too. 

‘He
looks so cute’ Alice spoke as she rolled in the grass along with Lucy. The
shiniest, brightest and the most colorful hairclip was still firmly clutched in
Lucy’s palm. 

‘What
is your name doggy?’ Lucy asked as she picked up the puppy and the puppy
tickled her face with his soft, pink tongue. 

‘Woof!
My name is Zero. Woof!’

‘Well!
You are lovely! Will you be our friend?’ Lucy asked Zero the puppy who copied
everything Lucy did. 

‘Woof!
Yes! Woof!’

‘My
name is Lucy and she is Alice’ Lucy said as she showed Zero, the puppy who
copied everything Lucy did, the brightest, shiniest and the most colorful
hairclip either one of them had ever seen.

‘Hello!’
Alice smiled before she started grimacing and yelling ‘YUCK! EWWW!’ as Zero,
the puppy who copied everything Lucy did, licked and tickled Alice with his
soft and pink tongue. Watching Alice and Zero play together, Lucy giggled
loudly. Hearing Lucy laugh out loud, Alice and Zero started laughing as well. 

They
laughed and rolled and jumped and skipped and sang the alphabets.

‘A
for Apple. B for Bat. C for Cat. D for Dog. E for… E for… E for Elephant’

Lucy,
the girl with the lovely long black hair, Alice, the brightest, shiniest and
the most colorful hairclip, and Zero, the puppy who copied everything Lucy did,
rolled, played and laughed in the grass which was as tall as Lucy’s knees. Dark
clouds covered the sky, curious to find out from where all the singing, playing
and laughing sounds were coming in. 

‘Who
is making all that noise?’ The dark cloud thundered.

‘We
are not making noise. We were just playing.’ Alice spoke.

‘Woof!
Yes! We were just playing. Woof!’ Zero barked back at the dark clouds.

‘My
name is Lucy. This is Alice and this is Zero. What is your name? Do you also want
to play with us?’ Lucy spoke as she looked up at the sky covered with the giant
dark cloud. 

‘My
name is Eddie, the dark cloud. Nobody plays with me because I am dark and not
white like the other clouds’ Eddie, the dark cloud thundered. 

‘You
can play with us. We were just singing, jumping, laughing and playing’ Lucy
replied as she smiled at Eddie, the dark cloud with whom the white clouds
didn’t play with. Eddie smiled in return, flashing his teeth and suddenly
lightening flashed across the sky.

‘Woof!
What was that?’ Zero, the puppy who copied everything Lucy did, whimpered.

‘Sorry!
That is what happens when I smile’ Eddie apologized.

‘That
is so cool! Can you smile again?’ Alice screamed with excitement.

‘I
guess’ Eddie replied as he smiled sheepishly and flashed his teeth shyly and a
tiny lightening shined through the sky. 

Together
the four new best friends walked towards Lucy’s home, skipping, laughing, and
singing the alphabets.

‘A
for Apple. B for Bat. C for Cat. D for Dog. E for… E for… E for elephant. F for
Four. G for… G for…’

Just
then the four new best friends saw a big and ugly lizard. The big and ugly lizard
opened his mouth and flicked his huge tongue to catch a butterfly which was as
colorful as Alice and ate it. 

‘Oh
no!’ Alice screamed. 

‘Woof!
Woof!’ Zero barked at the lizard. 

The
big and ugly lizard looked at the four new best friends and smiled menacingly. 

‘Well,
well, well… Look who we have here… Lucy, the girl with the big black hair,
Alice, the shiniest, brightest and the most colorful hairclip, Zero, the puppy
who copies everything Lucy does and Eddie, the dark cloud with whom the white
clouds don’t play with. You all will make for a nice delicious dinner tonight.’
The big and ugly lizard smirked as he looked at the four new best friends. 

‘Guys,
I am scared!’ Lucy whispered to her three best friends.

‘Don’t
worry Lucy. We are there with you. He can’t eat us.’ Eddie, the dark cloud,
thundered and lightening flashed across the sky as he smiled again. 

‘Yeah!
He is right.’ Alice spoke as she smiled along with Eddie. 

‘Woof!’
Zero, the puppy who copied everything Lucy did barked in agreement.

Buoyed
by her three best friends confidence, Lucy spoke, ‘I think I have a plan on how
to beat the big and ugly lizard’. Lucy then explained her plan to her three
best friends. The four new best friends smiled at each other as lightening
flashed across the sky again as Eddie flashed his white teeth again. 

‘You
don’t have anywhere to go’ The big and ugly lizard threatened. 

‘NOW!
Lucy yelled. 

Eddie,
the dark cloud with whom the white clouds refused to play with, grinned as he
showed all his white teeth causing a big lightening to streak across the sky.
Zero, the puppy who copied everything Lucy did, jumped in the air with Alice, the
brightest, shiniest and the most colorful hairclip, in his mouth and Alice
caught Eddie’s smile in her hairclip. Lucy took the lightening and threw it at
the big and ugly lizard. 

The
big and ugly lizard saw the big lightening hurled towards him and started
running for his life. 

‘I
will see the four of you soon. This is not over’ the big and ugly lizard yelled
as he ran away scared. So scared that he left his tail behind. 

The
four new best friends jumped in the air and high fived each other. 

Just
then, Lucy, the girl with the big, black hair heard her mother call her name. 

‘Lucy?
Where have you been?’

‘Mommy!
I want you to meet my new best friends. This is Alice, the shiniest, brightest
and the most hairclip. This is Zero, the puppy who copies everything I do. And
this is Eddie, the dark cloud with whom the white clouds refuse to play with.’

‘Hello!’
Lucy’s mother greeted Lucy’s friends and Lucy’s new best friends greeted Lucy’s
mother in return.

‘Mommy!
Do you think they can stay with us? Please?’ Lucy asked her mother with a smile
as big her father’s mustache. 

‘Only
if they help you finish your homework and sleep with you on time.’ Lucy’s
mother replied. Lucy had asked her mother nicely and she had said ‘Please’. 

‘Yayyy!’
The four new best friends jumped in the air and high fived each other again.
